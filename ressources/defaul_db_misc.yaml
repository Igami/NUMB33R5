        It smells and tastes a lot like very strong thyme, though slightly more peppery
        and with a lightly bitter aftertaste. Dry roasting Ajowan or frying it in
        oil mellows the flavour and brings out a caraway taste.'

        its name from the fact that it tastes somewhat like a peppery blend of cinnamon,
        clove and nutmeg.


        Allspice loses its flavour very quickly when ground, its recommend to buy
        whole berries and grinding them yourself just before using.'

        used chile in Mexico.

        flavour. It is often used to flavour pumpernickel and rye bread, crackers,
        sauerkraut, and pork dishes.

    name: Cardamom, Black
    notes: In a way, it's not fair that this spice has to share its name with the
        sweet and elegant green cardamom. Black cardamom is a totally different spice,
        and is not nearly as glamourous. Its pods are large and rough, it has an earthy,
        smoky flavour and it can never be used as a substitute for the more expensive
        and popular green variety. It does have its place, though. Black cardamom
        is used to give depth to Indian cooking, and it can be an important ingredient
        in many curry masalas.

    name: Citric Acid
    notes: Citric acid is a mild natural acid found in citrus fruits; it is responsible
        for the sourness of lemons and limes. In its pure form, citric acid looks
        pretty much exactly like granulated sugar and acts as a natural preservative
        and a tart flavouring. It is sometimes used in the making of wine and ice
        cream, and is widely used in softdrinks, sour candies and other recipes to
        mimic the flavour of fresh lemon.

        of almonds. Really delicious and unusual.

    notes: White peppercorns are picked from the vine when they are almost ripe -

        sun-dried. White peppercorns contain less essential oil than black peppercorns,
        as this is in the skin, so they have less aroma and a sweetish pungency to
        them.
