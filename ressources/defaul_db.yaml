    notes: The darkest of all malts, use sparingly to add deep color and roast-charcoal
        flavor. Use no more than 1 to 3%. Best used in trace amounts only, for color.

        using another malt with less harsh flavor impacts.

    notes: Complex flavored 2-Row Biscuit-style Malt. This hybrid drum roasted malt
        has an array of both caramel and dry roasted flavors. Use to develop flavors
        associated with darker, high gravity beers like Doppelbock. Equally well suited
        for mid to dark Belgian style ales. Adds complexity to Abbey styles and darker
        styles like dry Irish Stouts and Porters. Contributes dark reed to deep copper
        colors. At higher usage it contributes lighter brown hues.

        enzymes. Use 5 to 20% for these properties without adding color.

    notes: Ideal for British Porters and Brown or Mild Ales and even Stouts. It's
        a little darker than US Chocolate malt yet it has a slightly smoother character
        in the roast flavor and aroma profiles.

    notes: Being the least roasted of the black malts, Chocolate malt will add a dark
        color and pleasant roast flavor. Small quantities lend a nutty flavor and
        deep, ruby red color while higher amounts lend a black color and smooth, roasted
        flavor. Use 3 to 12%.

    notes: A little darker than German Munich malt and adds a deeper color and fuller
        malt profile. Great for Dark and amber lagers, blend Munich with German Pils
        or Domestic 2 Row at the rate of 10 to 60% of the total grain bill.

    notes: Use to make wheat and weizen beers at 40-60% for wheat and 35-65% for Bavarian
        weizens. Small amounts at about 3-6 % aid in head retention to any beer without
        altering final flavor. Use with a highly modified malt to insure diastatic
        enzymes. Protein rest highly recommended due to very high protein content.

    notes: Fully modified British malt, easily converted by a single temperature mash.
        Preferred by many brewers for authentic English ales. This malt has undergone
        higher kilning than Domestic 2 Row and is lower in diastatic power so keep
        adjuncts at a lower percentage.

    name: Pale Malt (2 Row) US
    notes: A variety of malt that forms two seed rows along the stem on the grain
        head. Well modified with a high diastatic power allows mashing with up to
        35% grain adjuncts. Because it is fairly neutral 2-Row makes an excellent
        base malt and is known as the "workhorse" of many recipes. Greater starch
        per weight ratio than 6-Row. Protein rest recommended to avoid chill-haze.
        Also know as Klages.

        added diastatic strength is needed in a recipe. 6-Row also has greater husks
        per weight ratio than 2-Row. Protein rest recommended to avoid chill-haze.

    name: Special B Malt
    notes: Special B refers to a type of dark, flavorful crystal malt traditionally
        malted in Belgium. In small amounts, it gives a unique flavor to the finished
        beer that is often compared to raisins or dried fruit. This malt is always
        dark, but the color and flavor vary more than most other malt styles; most
        of the commonly available varieties are in the 110-160 L range, but it may
        be even darker. Don't depend on this software to calculate the color of your
        beer correctly, since it may be expecting a much darker malt than you are
        actually using; some older sources assume Special B will be over 200 or even
        up to 300 L. While some sources still claim that Special B must be mashed,
        it is a crystal malt and can be steeped with an extract batch without adding
        significant protein to the beer.

    notes: "Special Roast Malt is a specially processed malt from the American maltster,\
        \ Briess. It is kilned using 6 row barley and it appears to be Victory Malt\
        \ turned up a notch. Flavor: Toasty, Strong Biscuit, Sour Dough, Tangy. Any\
        \ non-straw colored beer where roasty, toasty flavors are acceptable is a\
        \ good candidate for this malt. Porters and Nut Brown Ales could take a good\
        \ helping of this malt, and smaller amounts (less than 8 ounces) would work\
        \ in Viennas, M\xE4rzens, and Alt beers."

    notes: "Vienna Malt is a kiln-dried barley malt darker than pale ale malt, but\
        \ not as dark as Munich Malt. It imparts a golden to orange color and a distinctive\
        \ toast or biscuit malt aroma to the beer. Vienna malt traditionally makes\
        \ up up to 100% of the grist of Vienna Lager and the bulk of the related M\xE4\
        rzen style. Other beer styles sometimes use Vienna malt to add malty complexity\
        \ and light toasty notes to lighter base malts, or to lighten the grist of\
        \ a beer brewed with mostly Munich malt. Examples include Baltic Porter, Dunkelweizen,\
        \ and most styles of Bock."

    name: Wheat, Flaked
    notes: Flaked wheat is not malted, therefore requires extra effort to extract
        it's potential sugar content, which will be lower than malted wheat. Flaked
        wheat is traditional in Belgian witbier and lambics, it contains more starch
        and higher levels of protein than malted wheat. It adds more mouthfeel than
        malted wheat and has a different taste, which is noticeable when used in larger
        quantities. If the grain bill consists of more than 25% flaked wheat you should
        consider a cereal mash, or precooking the wheat in order to gelatinize it
        so you can extract more sugars out of it. The addion of 6-row can aid conversion
        since the barley contains a higher percentage of enzymes than 2-row.

    name: Wheat, Torrified
    notes: Torrified wheat is unmalted wheat that has been heated very quickly to
        get the kernel to puff up, kind of like popcorn. Torrified wheat adds a different
        flavor to the beer and the grain is gelatinized so you don't have to cook
        it.

    name: Special B Malt
    notes: Special B refers to a type of dark, flavorful crystal malt traditionally
        malted in Belgium. In small amounts, it gives a unique flavor to the finished
        beer that is often compared to raisins or dried fruit. This malt is always
        dark, but the color and flavor vary more than most other malt styles; most
        of the commonly available varieties are in the 110-160 L range, but it may
        be even darker. Don't depend on this software to calculate the color of your
        beer correctly, since it may be expecting a much darker malt than you are
        actually using; some older sources assume Special B will be over 200 or even
        up to 300 L. While some sources still claim that Special B must be mashed,
        it is a crystal malt and can be steeped with an extract batch without adding
        significant protein to the beer.

    name: Special Roast
    notes: "Special Roast Malt is a specially processed malt from the American maltster,\
        \ Briess. It is kilned using 6 row barley and it appears to be Victory Malt\
        \ turned up a notch. Flavor: Toasty, Strong Biscuit, Sour Dough, Tangy. Any\
        \ non-straw colored beer where roasty, toasty flavors are acceptable is a\
        \ good candidate for this malt. Porters and Nut Brown Ales could take a good\
        \ helping of this malt, and smaller amounts (less than 8 ounces) would work\
        \ in Viennas, M\xE4rzens, and Alt beers."

    name: Special B Malt
    notes: Special B refers to a type of dark, flavorful crystal malt traditionally
        malted in Belgium. In small amounts, it gives a unique flavor to the finished
        beer that is often compared to raisins or dried fruit. This malt is always
        dark, but the color and flavor vary more than most other malt styles; most
        of the commonly available varieties are in the 110-160 L range, but it may
        be even darker. Don't depend on this software to calculate the color of your
        beer correctly, since it may be expecting a much darker malt than you are
        actually using; some older sources assume Special B will be over 200 or even
        up to 300 L. While some sources still claim that Special B must be mashed,
        it is a crystal malt and can be steeped with an extract batch without adding
        significant protein to the beer.

    name: Gladfield - Ale Malt
    notes: 'Gladfield Ale malt has very similar attributes to the Pilsner malt but
        only winter grown English bread 2 row varieties are used. The malt is fully
        modified through a traditional long cool germination.


        This is a highly friable malt but again the soluble nitrogen ratios are kept
        relatively low to enhance mouth feel and head retention. The kilning regime
        gives a nice toasty character with enhanced maltiness for dark ales. This
        can be toned down for a cleaner malt profile for a lighter hoppy pale ale
        by adding small amounts of Pilsner malt.


        A single step mash of between 66 and 68C is sufficient to avoid any lautering
        problems and obtain good extract however multi step mashes may improve extract
        potential and improve stability in the bottle. Mash pH should be adjusted
        correctly to achieve brew house efficiency.'

    name: Gladfield - American Ale Malt
    notes: Gladfields American Ale malt is our answer for brewers who have found that
        our regular Ale malt will add too much of a malty and toasted flavour profile
        to certain beer styles. This malt starts as all our other base malts do with
        our traditional long cool germination period. What separates it from our standard
        Ale malt is a newly developed a kilning recipe that favours colour formation
        typical to an Ale malt but with a clean malt profile and without the extra
        toasted flavours. This malt has been a favourite for producing popular hop-forward
        American style beers for which it was named.

    name: Gladfield - Aurora Malt
    notes: Aurora has been developed to produce rich bready, fruit cake aroma and
        deep red colour. It has a long traditional germination process to create complex
        sugars and amino acids which react during a careful kilning regime. The resulting
        Maillard reaction is responsible for the deep red colour. It is ideal for
        Dark Ales, Belgium style and high alcohol beers for balance and beer stability.
        If you want to make that big malty, rich beer then this is a great malt to
        use along with our Crystals and Red Back.

        from husk damage. This malt will impart a dry biscuity flavour to the beer
        along with nice amber colour. Ideal in Porters, Stouts, Dark Ales or Dunkels
        in carful amounts.

    notes: Gladiator Malt is a malt specially developed to provide extra foaming stability,
        mouth feel and body to the beer with out adding too much colour. Like crystal
        malts Gladiator has a high amount of unfermentable sugars. These unfermentable
        sugars will help increase the final gravity and improve beer stability. The
        final processing of the malt has been done in such a way to reduce colour
        build up. Because of this Gladiator has proved very popular for use in a wide
        range of beer styles.

    name: Gladfield - Manuka Smoked Malt
    notes: We take our top quality New Zealand malt and smoke it over 100% Manuka
        wood from the West Coast. This malt has a smooth smoke character that is both
        floral and sweet. Perfect for a Kiwi twist to a Rauchbier or to add something
        unique to almost any beer style. Use this malt anywhere between 1 and 100%
        depending on the required smoke level.

    name: Gladfield - Medium Crystal Malt
    notes: 'All Crystal malts are made in a specialised roasting drum. The green malt
        used is made from the fattest low nitrogen 2 row barley available. The emphases
        are on sweetness and evenness of crystallisation. This is achieved by using
        only the best barley and batch malting small amounts of green malt at a time
        to feed the roaster.

        The evenness of colour is achieved by using the latest technology in malt
        roasting and heat recirculation to avoid scorching. Crystal malts can be used
        in varying amounts and intensities to an array of beer styles to add colour,
        flavour, aroma and stability to the beer. It is important to use crystal malts
        fresh to get the best results.'

    name: Gladfield - Munich Malt
    notes: 'Gladfield Munich malt is germinated similar to the Vienna malt using slightly
        higher nitrogen barley to create more intense colour through greater maillard
        reactions. This is achieved with a kilning regime that includes higher levels
        of moist air recirculation during the early and intermediate stages of the
        kilning cycle followed by high final curing temperatures. The resulting malt
        is rich, sweat, toasty and biscuity with a touch of breadiness.

        This malt is ideal for darker style Lagers or Ales and high alcohol beers.'

    name: Gladfield - Pilsner Malt
    notes: 'Gladfield Pilsener malt is made from 2 row English and European bred barley
        varieties. Only plump low protein barley is used which allows for higher extract
        potential and helps eliminate potential protein haze issues in the beer.


        The plumpness and even germination along with low protein gives highly friable
        malt and care must be taken not to over crush. Protein modification is kept
        relatively low with out compromising overall quality of the malt. These attributes''
        make Gladfield Pilsner malt well suited for craft brewing, the lower protein
        modification improves mouth feel and head retention.


        Carefully controlled kilning gives a nice malty character with out too much
        colour. Gladfield Pilsner malt has sufficient diastatic power to convert the
        addition of 10-20% coloured malts but it is not designed for large amounts
        of unmalted adjuncts. It is important that mash pH is controlled properly
        to obtain the best efficiencies and desired outcomes.'

    name: Gladfield - Red Back Malt
    notes: The Red Back Malt is also a unique malt made by Gladfield. It is prepared
        by a special process before going into the roaster. It is then roasted in
        a particular way to create certain Maillard reactions which causes the malt
        to produce a lovely red hue in the resulting beer without the opalescence
        that can occur with other similar malts. In other words the wort colour is
        bright with good clarity but most of all a lovely red colour. It goes well
        with our Pale Ale and Aurora malt which is a melanoidin malt.

    name: Gladfield - Roasted Wheat
    notes: Our Roasted Wheat is produced by roasting unmalted wheat. It is a great
        way to get those roasted coffee and chocolate flavours without the extra bitterness
        that comes from roasted barley or chocolate malt. The wheat malt, lacking
        its outer husk, is less susceptible to burning at the higher roasting temperatures
        which prevents bitter and astringent flavors. This malt is a great addition
        to any darker beer style.

    name: Gladfield - Shepherds Delight Malt
    notes: Shepherds Delight is what we would consider a stepped up version of our
        Aurora malt. It has intense bready, toasted and kola flavour with a lingering
        fruity sweetness. This malt should be used sparingly to supercharge the maltiness
        of a beer and will give flavours similar to a decoction mash. Used at too
        high a concentration could lead to bitterness in the final beer we recommend
        combining Shepherds Delight with our Vienna malt to give a balancing sweetness.
        This malt will also give some red highlights to the beers colour. Recommended
        usage level of 8% Maximum.

    name: Gladfield - Sour Grapes Malt
    notes: Gladfield Sour Grapes malt is designed for pH adjustment in the brew house

        germination from naturally present bacteria on the grain and a lactic bath
        prior to kilning grown from the same lactobacillus strains. Recommended usage
        of between 1% and 5% to achieve target mash pH.

    name: Gladfield - Toffee Malt
    notes: The Toffee Malt is a unique malt produced by Gladfield. It is basically
        a fully caramalised malt that has been roasted at very low temperature. This
        special roasting cycle produces a very light colour and the resulting malt
        is toffee like to chew instead of the crystalised popcorn affect of using
        higher temperatures. The resulting malt is very popular for adding a malty
        toffee flavour to lighter colured beers and also adds good beer stability,
        body and mouth feel.

    name: Gladfield - Vienna Malt
    notes: Gladfield Vienna has a kiwi twist but still has the normal characteristics
        of typical Vienna malt. The germination and kilning allows a sweeter maltier
        character with out over doing it. It is ideal for darker lagers or Marzen
        style beers. The Gladfield Vienna goes well with Gladiator and Toffee giving
        a big white head and lovely golden redy lager for that drinkable session beer.

        from an old English wheat variety that modifies very well. The resulting malt
        gives clean light coloured wort.

    name: Gladfield - Supernova Malt
    notes: 'Supernova malt is a new roasted malt from Gladfield that adds nutty, toasted
        caramel flavours to a beer. It can be used as a replacement for traditional
        crystal malts to change the flavour characteristics and reduce the beers residual
        sweetness. We start this malt with Canterbury winter barley and take it through
        our germination process before it is roasted to develop flavour and colour.


        This is a great malt to be used in any beer style. We have already seen it
        used in Pilsners and IPAs between 10 - 25%. We also recommend its use in an
        Amber Ale up to 25%, it adds a rich depth of malty flavour and really makes
        this style shine. It goes well in a Porter up to 10-15%, complementing the
        darker roast malts and adding complexity. Also great for Pale Ales for great
        toasty caramel flavours that won''t overtake the hops, use 5-10%'

    notes: 'Ajowan seed (also known as carom seed) is native to southern India and
        is used commonly throughout southern Asia and the Middle East.


        It smells and tastes a lot like very strong thyme, though slightly more peppery
        and with a lightly bitter aftertaste. Dry roasting Ajowan or frying it in
        oil mellows the flavour and brings out a caraway taste.'

    notes: 'Allspice is a ground mixture of baking spices. In reality, allspice is
        the berry of the pimento bush, grown mostly in Jamaica. It does, however get
        its name from the fact that it tastes somewhat like a peppery blend of cinnamon,
        clove and nutmeg.


        Allspice loses its flavour very quickly when ground, its recommend to buy
        whole berries and grinding them yourself just before using.'

        are deep red-brown and have a wonderful, sweet raisiny flavour that provide
        lots of personality to food without a lot of heat. These are the most commonly
        used chile in Mexico.

    notes: In a way, it's not fair that this spice has to share its name with the
        sweet and elegant green cardamom. Black cardamom is a totally different spice,
        and is not nearly as glamourous. Its pods are large and rough, it has an earthy,
        smoky flavour and it can never be used as a substitute for the more expensive
        and popular green variety. It does have its place, though. Black cardamom
        is used to give depth to Indian cooking, and it can be an important ingredient
        in many curry masalas.

    notes: Citric acid is a mild natural acid found in citrus fruits; it is responsible
        for the sourness of lemons and limes. In its pure form, citric acid looks
        pretty much exactly like granulated sugar and acts as a natural preservative
        and a tart flavouring. It is sometimes used in the making of wine and ice
        cream, and is widely used in softdrinks, sour candies and other recipes to
        mimic the flavour of fresh lemon.

    notes: Szechuan pepper is the outer husk of the fruit of the Chinese prickly ash
        tree. The berries are dried and split open, and the bitter seeds inside are
        discarded. The flavour of Szechuan pepper is very fragrant, lemony and pungent
        and it has a biting astringency on the tongue

    name: Tonka Beans
    notes: Tonka beans are very unusual little beans that grow primarily in the northern
        part of South America. They share a lot of similarities with vanilla beans,
        to the point where they are sometimes used as a vanilla substitute. They are
        black and wrinkly, about an inch long, and have a sweet flavour that is like
        a combination of vanilla, cloves and cinnamon with a nuttiness reminiscent
        of almonds. Really delicious and unusual.

    name: Peppercorns, White
    notes: White peppercorns are picked from the vine when they are almost ripe -
        much later than black or green peppercorns. When picked, they are a yellowish-pink
        colour. The peppercorns are treated with water to remove the skin, and then
        sun-dried. White peppercorns contain less essential oil than black peppercorns,
        as this is in the skin, so they have less aroma and a sweetish pungency to
        them.

    ingredients: Pale ale malt, typically American two-row. Medium to dark crystal
        malts. May also contain specialty grains which add additional character and
        uniqueness. American hops, often with citrusy flavors, are common but others
        may also be used. Water can vary in sulfate and carbonate content.
    name: American Amber Ale
    notes: Can overlap in color with American pale ales. However, American amber ales
        differ from American pale ales not only by being usually darker in color,
        but also by having more caramel flavor, more body, and usually being balanced
        more evenly between malt and bitterness. Should not have a strong chocolate
        or roast character that might suggest an American brown ale (although small
        amounts are OK).

    profile: Low to moderate hop aroma from dry hopping or late kettle additions of
        American hop varieties. A citrusy hop character is common, but not required.
        Moderately low to moderately high maltiness balances and sometimes masks the
        hop presentation, and usually shows a moderate caramel character. Esters vary
        from moderate to none. No diacetyl.Amber to coppery brown in color. Moderately
        large off-white head with good retention. Generally quite clear, although
        dry-hopped versions may be slightly hazy.Moderate to high hop flavor from
        American hop varieties, which often but not always has a citrusy quality.
        Malt flavors are moderate to strong, and usually show an initial malty sweetness
        followed by a moderate caramel flavor (and sometimes other character malts
        in lesser amounts). Malt and hop bitterness are usually balanced and mutually
        supportive. Fruity esters can be moderate to none. Caramel sweetness and hop
        flavor/bitterness can linger somewhat into the medium to full finish. No diacetyl.Medium
        to medium-full body. Carbonation moderate to high. Overall smooth finish without
        astringency often associated with high hopping rates. Stronger versions may
        have a slight alcohol warmth.Like an American pale ale with more body, more
        caramel richness, and a balance more towards malt than hops (although hop
        rates can be significant). Known simply as Red Ales in some regions, these
        beers were popularized in the hop-loving Northern California and the Pacific
        Northwest areas before spreading nationwide.

    ingredients: Well-modified pale malt should form the backbone of the grist. Some
        specialty or character malts may be used. Dark malts should be used with great
        restraint, if at all, as most of the color arises from a lengthy boil.  Citrusy
        American hops are common, although any varieties can be used in quantity.
        Generally uses an attenuative American yeast.
    name: American Barleywine
    notes: The American version of the Barleywine tends to have a greater emphasis
        on hop bitterness, flavor and aroma than the English Barleywine, and often
        features American hop varieties. Differs from an Imperial IPA in that the
        hops are not extreme, the malt is more forward, and the body is richer and
        more characterful.

    profile: Very rich and intense maltiness. Hop character moderate to assertive
        and often showcases citrusy or resiny American varieties (although other varieties,
        such as floral, earthy or spicy English varieties or a blend of varieties,
        may be used). Low to moderately strong fruity esters and alcohol aromatics.
        Malt character may be sweet, caramelly, bready, or fairly neutral. However,
        the intensity of aromatics often subsides with age. No diacetyl.Color may
        range from light amber to medium copper; may rarely be as dark as light brown.
        Often has ruby highlights. Moderately-low to large off-white to light tan
        head; may have low head retention. May be cloudy with chill haze at cooler
        temperatures, but generally clears to good to brilliant clarity as it warms.
        The color may appear to have great depth, as if viewed through a thick glass
        lens. High alcohol and viscosity may be visible in "legs" when beer is swirled
        in a glass.Strong, intense malt flavor with noticeable bitterness. Moderately
        low to moderately high malty sweetness on the palate, although the finish
        may be somewhat sweet to quite dry (depending on aging). Hop bitterness may
        range from moderately strong to aggressive. While strongly malty, the balance
        should always seem bitter. Moderate to high hop flavor (any variety). Low
        to moderate fruity esters. Noticeable alcohol presence, but sharp or solventy
        alcohol flavors are undesirable. Flavors will smooth out and decline over
        time, but any oxidized character should be muted (and generally be masked
        by the hop character). May have some bready or caramelly malt flavors, but
        these should not be high. Roasted or burnt malt flavors are inappropriate.
        No diacetyl.Full-bodied and chewy, with a velvety, luscious texture (although
        the body may decline with long conditioning). Alcohol warmth should be present,
        but not be excessively hot. Should not be syrupy and under-attenuated. Carbonation
        may be low to moderate, depending on age and conditioning.A well-hopped American
        interpretation of the richest and strongest of the English ales. The hop character
        should be evident throughout, but does not have to be unbalanced. The alcohol
        strength and hop bitterness often combine to leave a very long finish. Usually
        the strongest ale offered by a brewery, and in recent years many commercial
        examples are now vintage-dated. Normally aged significantly prior to release.
        Often associated with the winter or holiday season.

    ingredients: Well-modified pale malt, either American or Continental, plus crystal
        and darker malts should complete the malt bill. American hops are typical,
        but UK or noble hops can also be used. Moderate carbonate water would appropriately
        balance the dark malt acidity.
    name: American Brown Ale
    notes: A strongly flavored, hoppy brown beer, originated by American home brewers.
        Related to American Pale and American Amber Ales, although with more of a
        caramel and chocolate character, which tends to balance the hop bitterness
        and finish. Most commercial American Browns are not as aggressive as the original
        homebrewed versions, and some modern craft brewed examples. IPA-strength brown
        ales should be entered in the Specialty Beer category (23).

    profile: 'Malty, sweet and rich, which often has a chocolate, caramel, nutty and/or

        yet stops short of being overly porter-like. The malt and hops are generally
        balanced. Moderately low to no diacetyl.Light to very dark brown color. Clear.
        Low to moderate off-white to light tan head.Medium to high malty flavor (often
        with caramel, toasty and/or chocolate flavors), with medium to medium-high

        have a citrusy character. Very low to moderate fruity esters. Moderately low
        to no diacetyl.Medium to medium-full body. More bitter versions may have a
        dry, resiny impression. Moderate to moderately high carbonation. Stronger
        versions may have some alcohol warmth in the finish.Can be considered a bigger,

    profile: A prominent to intense hop aroma with a citrusy, floral, perfume-like,
        resinous, piney, and/or fruity character derived from American hops. Many
        versions are dry hopped and can have an additional grassy aroma, although
        this is not required. Some clean malty sweetness may be found in the background,
        but should be at a lower level than in English examples. Fruitiness, either
        from esters or hops, may also be detected in some versions, although a neutral
        fermentation character is also acceptable. Some alcohol may be noted.Color
        ranges from medium gold to medium reddish copper; some versions can have an
        orange-ish tint. Should be clear, although unfiltered dry-hopped versions
        may be a bit hazy. Good head stand with white to off-white color should persist.Hop
        flavor is medium to high, and should reflect an American hop character with
        citrusy, floral, resinous, piney or fruity aspects. Medium-high to very high
        hop bitterness, although the malt backbone will support the strong hop character
        and provide the best balance. Malt flavor should be low to medium, and is
        generally clean and malty sweet although some caramel or toasty flavors are
        acceptable at low levels. No diacetyl. Low fruitiness is acceptable but not
        required. The bitterness may linger into the aftertaste but should not be
        harsh. Medium-dry to dry finish. Some clean alcohol flavor can be noted in
        stronger versions. Oak is inappropriate in this style. May be slightly sulfury,
        but most examples do not exhibit this character.Smooth, medium-light to medium-bodied
        mouthfeel without hop-derived astringency, although moderate to medium-high
        carbonation can combine to render an overall dry sensation in the presence
        of malt sweetness. Some smooth alcohol warming can and should be sensed in
        stronger (but not all) versions. Body is generally less than in English counterparts.A
        decidedly hoppy and bitter, moderately strong American pale ale. An American
        version of the historical English style, brewed using American ingredients
        and attitude.

    ingredients: Pale ale malt, typically American two-row. American hops, often but
        not always ones with a citrusy character. American ale yeast. Water can vary
        in sulfate content, but carbonate content should be relatively low. Specialty
        grains may add character and complexity, but generally make up a relatively
        small portion of the grist. Grains that add malt flavor and richness, light
        sweetness, and toasty or bready notes are often used (along with late hops)
        to differentiate brands.
    name: American Pale Ale
    notes: There is some overlap in color between American pale ale and American amber
        ale. The American pale ale will generally be cleaner, have a less caramelly
        malt profile, less body, and often more finishing hops.

        and may optionally show small amounts of specialty malt character (bready,
        toasty, biscuity). Fruity esters vary from moderate to none. No diacetyl.

        Low to moderately high clean malt character supports the hop presentation,

        but the malt presence can be substantial. Caramel flavors are usually restrained
        or absent. Fruity esters can be moderate to none. Moderate to high hop bitterness
        with a medium to dry finish. Hop flavor and bitterness often lingers into
        the finish. No diacetyl. Dry hopping (if used) may add grassy notes, although
        this character should not be excessive.Medium-light to medium body. Carbonation
        moderate to high. Overall smooth finish without astringency often associated
        with high hopping rates.Refreshing and hoppy, yet with sufficient supporting
        malt. An American adaptation of English pale ale, reflecting indigenous ingredients
        (hops, malt, yeast, and water). Often lighter in color, cleaner in fermentation
        by-products, and having less caramel flavors than English counterparts.

        chocolate or black malt. Munich or Vienna base malt. Continental hops. May
        contain crystal malts and/or adjuncts. Brown or amber malt common in historical
        recipes.
    name: Baltic Porter
    notes: May also be described as an Imperial Porter, although heavily roasted or
        hopped versions should be entered as either Imperial Stouts (13F) or Specialty
        Beers (23).

    profile: Rich malty sweetness often containing caramel, toffee, nutty to deep
        toast, and/or licorice notes. Complex alcohol and ester profile of moderate
        strength, and reminiscent of plums, prunes, raisins, cherries or currants,
        occasionally with a vinous Port-like quality. Some darker malt character that
        is deep chocolate, coffee or molasses but never burnt. No hops. No sourness.
        Very smooth.Dark reddish copper to opaque dark brown (not black). Thick, persistent
        tan-colored head. Clear, although darker versions can be opaque.As with aroma,
        has a rich malty sweetness with a complex blend of deep malt, dried fruit
        esters, and alcohol. Has a prominent yet smooth schwarzbier-like roasted flavor
        that stops short of burnt. Mouth-filling and very smooth. Clean lager character;
        no diacetyl. Starts sweet but darker malt flavors quickly dominates and persists
        through finish. Just a touch dry with a hint of roast coffee or licorice in
        the finish. Malt can have a caramel, toffee, nutty, molasses and/or licorice
        complexity. Light hints of black currant and dark fruits. Medium-low to medium
        bitterness from malt and hops, just to provide balance. Hop flavor from slightly
        spicy hops (Lublin or Saaz types) ranges from none to medium-low.Generally
        quite full-bodied and smooth, with a well-aged alcohol warmth (although the
        rarer lower gravity Carnegie-style versions will have a medium body and less
        warmth). Medium to medium-high carbonation, making it seem even more mouth-filling.
        Not heavy on the tongue due to carbonation level. Most versions are in the
        7-8.5% ABV range.A Baltic Porter often has the malt flavors reminiscent of
        an English brown porter and the restrained roast of a schwarzbier, but with
        a higher OG and alcohol content than either. Very complex, with multi-layered
        flavors. Traditional beer from countries bordering the Baltic Sea. Derived
        from English porters but influenced by Russian Imperial Stouts.

    ingredients: Belgian Pils malt, aromatic malts, sugar, Belgian yeast strains that
        produce complex alcohol, phenolics and perfumy esters, noble, Styrian Goldings
        or East Kent Goldings hops. No spices are traditionally used, although the
        ingredients and fermentation by-products may give an impression of spicing
        (often reminiscent of oranges or lemons).
    name: Belgian Blond Ale
    notes: Similar strength as a dubbel, similar character as a Belgian Strong Golden
        Ale or Tripel, although a bit sweeter and not as bitter. Often has an almost
        lager-like character, which gives it a cleaner profile in comparison to the
        other styles. Belgians use the term "Blond," while the French spell it "Blonde."
        Most commercial examples are in the 6.5 - 7% ABV range. Many Trappist table
        beers (singles or Enkels) are called "Blond" but these are not representative
        of this style.

        of a complex grain bill, although many traditional versions are quite simple,
        with caramelized sugar syrup or unrefined sugars and yeast providing much
        of the complexity. Homebrewers may use Belgian Pils or pale base malt, Munich-type
        malts for maltiness, other Belgian specialty grains for character. Caramelized
        sugar syrup or unrefined sugars lightens body and adds color and flavor (particularly
        if dark sugars are used). Noble-type, English-type or Styrian Goldings hops
        commonly used. Spices generally not used; if used, keep subtle and in the
        background. Avoid US/UK crystal type malts (these provide the wrong type of
        sweetness).

    profile: Complex, with a rich malty sweetness, significant esters and alcohol,
        and an optional light to moderate spiciness. The malt is rich and strong,
        and can have a Munich-type quality often with a caramel, toast and/or bready
        aroma. The fruity esters are strong to moderately low, and can contain raisin,
        plum, dried cherry, fig or prune notes. Spicy phenols may be present, but
        usually have a peppery quality not clove-like. Alcohols are soft, spicy, perfumy
        and/or rose-like, and are low to moderate in intensity. Hops are not usually
        present (but a very low noble hop aroma is acceptable). No diacetyl. No dark/roast
        malt aroma. No hot alcohols or solventy aromas. No recognizable spice additions.Deep
        amber to deep coppery-brown in color ("dark" in this context implies "more
        deeply colored than golden"). Huge, dense, moussy, persistent cream- to light
        tan-colored head. Can be clear to somewhat hazy.Similar to aroma (same malt,
        ester, phenol, alcohol, hop and spice comments apply to flavor as well). Moderately
        malty or sweet on palate. Finish is variable depending on interpretation (authentic
        Trappist versions are moderately dry to dry, Abbey versions can be medium-dry
        to sweet). Low bitterness for a beer of this strength; alcohol provides some
        of the balance to the malt. Sweeter and more full-bodied beers will have a
        higher bitterness level to balance. Almost all versions are malty in the balance,
        although a few are lightly bitter. The complex and varied flavors should blend
        smoothly and harmoniously.High carbonation but no carbonic acid "bite." Smooth
        but noticeable alcohol warmth. Body can be variable depending on interpretation
        (authentic Trappist versions tend to be medium-light to medium, while Abbey-style
        beers can be quite full and creamy).A dark, very rich, complex, very strong
        Belgian ale. Complex, rich, smooth and dangerous. Most versions are unique
        in character reflecting characteristics of individual breweries.

    ingredients: The light color and relatively light body for a beer of this strength
        are the result of using Pilsner malt and up to 20% white sugar. Noble hops
        or Styrian Goldings are commonly used. Belgian yeast strains are used that
        produce fruity esters, spicy phenolics and higher alcohols often aided by
        slightly warmer fermentation temperatures. Fairly soft water.
    name: Belgian Golden Strong Ale
    notes: Strongly resembles a Tripel, but may be even paler, lighter-bodied and
        even crisper and drier. The drier finish and lighter body also serves to make
        the assertive hopping and spiciness more prominent. References to the devil
        are included in the names of many commercial examples of this style, referring
        to their potent alcoholic strength and as a tribute to the original example
        (Duvel). The best examples are complex and delicate. High carbonation helps
        to bring out the many flavors and to increase the perception of a dry finish.

        is often present. Alcohols are soft, spicy, often a bit sweet and are low-to-moderate
        in intensity. Bitterness is typically medium to high from a combination of
        hop bitterness and yeast-produced phenolics. Substantial carbonation and bitterness
        leads to a dry finish with a low to moderately bitter aftertaste. No diacetyl.Very
        highly carbonated. Light to medium body, although lighter than the substantial
        gravity would suggest (thanks to sugar and high carbonation). Smooth but noticeable

    ingredients: Pilsner or pale ale malt contributes the bulk of the grist with (cara)
        Vienna and Munich malts adding color, body and complexity. Sugar is not commonly
        used as high gravity is not desired. Noble hops, Styrian Goldings, East Kent
        Goldings or Fuggles are commonly used. Yeasts prone to moderate production
        of phenols are often used but fermentation temperatures should be kept moderate
        to limit this character.
    name: Belgian Pale Ale
    notes: Most commonly found in the Flemish provinces of Antwerp and Brabant. Considered
        "everyday" beers (Category I). Compared to their higher alcohol Category S
        cousins, they are Belgian "session beers" for ease of drinking. Nothing should
        be too pronounced or dominant; balance is the key.

    name: Belgian Specialty Ale
    notes: 'This is a catch-all category for any Belgian-style beer not fitting any
        other Belgian style category. The category can be used for clones of specific
        beers (e.g., Orval, La Chouffe,''); to produce a beer fitting a broader style
        that doesn''t have its own category; or to create an artisanal or experimental
        beer of the brewer''s own choosing (e.g., strong Belgian golden ale with spices,
        something unique). Creativity is the only limit in brewing but the entrants
        must identify what is special about their entry. This category may be used
        as an "incubator" for recognized styles for which there is not yet a formal
        BJCP category. Some styles falling into this classification include: Blond

    profile: Variable. Most exhibit varying amounts of fruity esters, spicy phenols
        and/or yeast-borne aromatics. Aromas from actual spice additions may be present.
        Hop aroma may be none to high, and may include a dry-hopped character. Malt
        aroma may be low to high, and may include character of non-barley grains such
        as wheat or rye. Some may include aromas of Belgian microbiota, most commonly
        Brettanomyces and/or Lactobacillus. No diacetyl.Variable. Color varies considerably
        from pale gold to very dark. Clarity may be hazy to clear. Head retention
        is usually good. Generally moderate to high carbonation.Variable. A great
        variety of flavors are found in these beers. Maltiness may be light to quite
        rich. Hop flavor and bitterness may be low to high. Spicy flavors may be imparted
        by yeast (phenolics) and/or actual spice additions. May include characteristics
        of grains other than barley, such as wheat or rye. May include flavors produced
        by Belgian microbiota such as Brettanomyces or Lactobacillus. May include
        flavors from adjuncts such as caramelized sugar syrup or honey.Variable. Some
        are well-attenuated, thus fairly light-bodied for their original gravity,
        while others are thick and rich. Most are moderately to highly carbonated.
        A warming sensation from alcohol may be present in stronger examples. A "mouth
        puckering" sensation may be present from acidity.Variable. This category encompasses
        a wide range of Belgian ales produced by truly artisanal brewers more concerned
        with creating unique products than in increasing sales. Unique beers of small,
        independent Belgian breweries that have come to enjoy local popularity but
        may be far less well-known outside of their own regions. Many have attained
        "cult status" in the U.S. (and other parts of the world) and now owe a significant
        portion of their sales to export.

    ingredients: "The light color and relatively light body for a beer of this strength\
        \ are the result of using Pilsner malt and up to 20% white sugar. Noble hops\
        \ or Styrian Goldings are commonly used. Belgian yeast strains are used \u2013\
        \ those that produce fruity esters, spicy phenolics and higher alcohols \u2013\
        \ often aided by slightly warmer fermentation temperatures. Spice additions\
        \ are generally not traditional, and if used, should not be recognizable as\
        \ such. Fairly soft water."
    name: Belgian Tripel
    notes: High in alcohol but does not taste strongly of alcohol. The best examples
        are sneaky, not obvious. High carbonation and attenuation helps to bring out
        the many flavors and to increase the perception of a dry finish. Most Trappist
        versions have at least 30 IBUs and are very dry. Traditionally bottle-conditioned
        ("refermented in the bottle").

    profile: Complex with moderate to significant spiciness, moderate fruity esters
        and low alcohol and hop aromas. Generous spicy, peppery, sometimes clove-like
        phenols. Esters are often reminiscent of citrus fruits such as oranges, but
        may sometimes have a slight banana character. A low yet distinctive spicy,
        floral, sometimes perfumy hop character is usually found. Alcohols are soft,
        spicy and low in intensity. No hot alcohol or solventy aromas. The malt character
        is light. No diacetyl.Deep yellow to deep gold in color. Good clarity. Effervescent.
        Long-lasting, creamy, rocky, white head resulting in characteristic "Belgian
        lace" on the glass as it fades.Marriage of spicy, fruity and alcohol flavors
        supported by a soft malt character. Low to moderate phenols are peppery in
        character. Esters are reminiscent of citrus fruit such as orange or sometimes
        lemon. A low to moderate spicy hop character is usually found. Alcohols are
        soft, spicy, often a bit sweet and low in intensity. Bitterness is typically
        medium to high from a combination of hop bitterness and yeast-produced phenolics.
        Substantial carbonation and bitterness lends a dry finish with a moderately
        bitter aftertaste. No diacetyl.Medium-light to medium body, although lighter
        than the substantial gravity would suggest (thanks to sugar and high carbonation).
        High alcohol content adds a pleasant creaminess but little to no obvious warming
        sensation. No hot alcohol or solventy character. Always effervescent. Never
        astringent.Strongly resembles a Strong Golden Ale but slightly darker and
        somewhat fuller-bodied. Usually has a more rounded malt flavor but should
        not be sweet. Originally popularized by the Trappist monastery at Westmalle.

    ingredients: Wheat malt content is typically 50% of the grist (as with all German
        wheat beers) with the remainder being Pilsner malt. A symbiotic fermentation
        with top-fermenting yeast and Lactobacillus delbruckii provides the sharp
        sourness, which may be enhanced by blending of beers of different ages during
        fermentation and by extended cool aging. Hop bitterness is extremely low.
        A single decoction mash with mash hopping is traditional.
    name: Berliner Weisse
    notes: In Germany, it is classified as a Schankbier denoting a small beer of starting
        gravity in the range 7-8P. Often served with the addition of a shot of sugar
        syrups ('mit schuss') flavored with raspberry ('himbeer') or woodruff ('waldmeister')
        or even mixed with Pils to counter the substantial sourness. Has been described
        by some as the most purely refreshing beer in the world.

    profile: A sharply sour, somewhat acidic character is dominant. Can have up to
        a moderately fruity character. The fruitiness may increase with age and a
        flowery character may develop. A mild Brettanomyces aroma may be present.
        No hop aroma, diacetyl, or DMS.Very pale straw in color. Clarity ranges from
        clear to somewhat hazy. Large, dense, white head with poor retention due to
        high acidity and low protein and hop content. Always effervescent.Clean lactic
        sourness dominates and can be quite strong, although not so acidic as a lambic.
        Some complementary bready or grainy wheat flavor is generally noticeable.
        Hop bitterness is very low. A mild Brettanomyces character may be detected,
        as may a restrained fruitiness (both are optional). No hop flavor. No diacetyl
        or DMS.Light body. Very dry finish. Very high carbonation. No sensation of
        alcohol.A very pale, sour, refreshing, low-alcohol wheat ale. A regional specialty
        of Berlin; referred to by Napoleon's troops in 1809 as "the Champagne of the
        North" due to its lively and elegant character. Only two traditional breweries
        still produce the product.

    ingredients: The "cellar" character in commercial examples is unlikely to be duplicated
        in homebrews as it comes from indigenous yeasts and molds. Commercial versions
        often have a "corked", dry, astringent character that is often incorrectly
        identified as "cellar-like." Homebrews therefore are usually cleaner. Base
        malts vary by beer color, but usually include pale, Vienna and Munich types.
        Kettle caramelization tends to be used more than crystal malts, when present.
        Darker versions will have richer malt complexity and sweetness from crystal-type
        malts. Sugar may be used to add flavor and aid in the dry finish. Lager or
        ale yeast fermented at cool ale temperatures, followed by long cold conditioning
        (4-6 weeks for commercial operations). Soft water. Floral, herbal or spicy
        continental hops.
    name: "Bi\xE8re de Garde"
    notes: "Three main variations are included in the style: the brown (brune), the\
        \ blond (blonde), and the amber (ambr\xE9e). The darker versions will have\
        \ more malt character, while the paler versions can have more hops (but still\
        \ are malt-focused beers). A related style is Bi\xE8re de Mars, which is brewed\
        \ in March (Mars) for present use and will not age as well. Attenuation rates\
        \ are in the 80-85% range. Some fuller-bodied examples exist, but these are\
        \ somewhat rare."

        \ often have a musty, woodsy, cellar-like character that is difficult to achieve\
        \ in homebrew.  Paler versions will still be malty but will lack richer, deeper\
        \ aromatics and may have a bit more hops. No diacetyl.Three main variations\

    profile: ' A Braggot is a mead made with malt. Depending on the sweetness, strength
        and base style of beer, a subtle to distinctly identifiable honey and beer
        character (dry and/or hydromel versions will tend to have lower aromatics
        than sweet and/or sack versions). The honey and beer/malt character should
        be complementary and balanced, although not always evenly balanced. If a variety
        of honey is declared, the aroma might have a subtle to very noticeable varietal
        character reflective of the honey (different varieties have different intensities
        and characters). If a base style of beer or type of malt is declared, the
        aroma might have a subtle to very noticeable character reflective of the beer
        style (different styles and malts have different intensities and characters).
        A hop aroma (any variety or intensity) is optional; if present, it should
        blend harmoniously with the other elements. Standard description applies for
        remainder of characteristics.Standard description does not apply due to beer-like
        characteristics. Clarity may be good to brilliant, although many braggots
        are not as clear as other meads. A light to moderate head with some retention
        is expected. Color may range from light straw to dark brown or black, depending
        on the variety of malt and honey used. The color should be characteristic
        of the declared beer style and/or honey used, if a variety is declared. Stronger
        versions may show signs of body (e.g., legs).Displays a balanced character
        identifiable as both a beer and a mead, although the relative intensity of
        flavors is greatly affected by the sweetness, strength, base style of beer,
        and variety of honey used. If a beer style is declared, the braggot should
        have some character traceable to the style although the flavors will be different
        due to the presence of honey. If a variety of honey is declared, the braggot
        should feature a subtle to prominent varietal character (different varieties
        have different intensities). Stronger and/or sweeter braggots should be expected
        to have a greater intensity of flavor than drier, lower gravity versions.
        The finish and aftertaste will vary based on the declared level of sweetness
        (dry to sweet), and may include both beer and mead components. A wide range
        of malt characteristics is allowable, from plain base malts to rich caramel
        and toast flavors to dark chocolate and roast flavors. Hop bitterness and
        flavor may be present, and may reflect any variety or intensity; however,
        this optional character should always be both suggestive of the base beer
        style and well blended with the other flavors. Standard description applies
        for remainder of characteristics.Standard description does not apply due to
        beer-like characteristics. Smooth mouthfeel without astringency. Body may
        vary from moderately light to full, depending on sweetness, strength, and
        the base style of beer. Note that stronger meads will have a fuller body.
        A very thin or watery body is undesirable, as is a cloying, raw sweetness.
        A warming sense of well-aged alcohol may be present in stronger examples.
        Carbonation will vary as described in the standard description. A still braggot
        will usually have some level of carbonation (like a cask bitter) since a completely
        flat beer is unappetizing. However, just as an aged barleywine may be still,
        some braggots can be totally still.A harmonious blend of mead and beer, with
        the distinctive characteristics of both. A wide range of results are possible,
        depending on the base style of beer, variety of honey and overall sweetness
        and strength. Beer flavors tend to somewhat mask typical honey flavors found
        in other meads. '

    ingredients: English ingredients are most common. May contain several malts, including
        chocolate and/or other dark roasted malts and caramel-type malts. Historical
        versions would use a significant amount of brown malt. Usually does not contain
        large amounts of black patent malt or roasted barley. English hops are most
        common, but are usually subdued. London or Dublin-type water (moderate carbonate
        hardness) is traditional. English or Irish ale yeast, or occasionally lager
        yeast, is used. May contain a moderate amount of adjuncts (sugars, maize,
        molasses, treacle, etc.).
    name: Brown Porter
    notes: Differs from a robust porter in that it usually has softer, sweeter and
        more caramelly flavors, lower gravities, and usually less alcohol. More substance
        and roast than a brown ale. Higher in gravity than a dark mild. Some versions
        are fermented with lager yeast. Balance tends toward malt more than hops.
        Usually has an "English" character. Historical versions with Brettanomyces,
        sourness, or smokiness should be entered in the Specialty Beer category (23).

    profile: Malt aroma with mild roastiness should be evident, and may have a chocolaty
        quality. May also show some non-roasted malt character in support (caramelly,
        grainy, bready, nutty, toffee-like and/or sweet). English hop aroma moderate
        to none. Fruity esters moderate to none. Diacetyl low to none.Light brown
        to dark brown in color, often with ruby highlights when held up to light.
        Good clarity, although may approach being opaque. Moderate off-white to light
        tan head with good to fair retention.Malt flavor includes a mild to moderate
        roastiness (frequently with a chocolate character) and often a significant
        caramel, nutty, and/or toffee character. May have other secondary flavors
        such as coffee, licorice, biscuits or toast in support. Should not have a
        significant black malt character (acrid, burnt, or harsh roasted flavors),
        although small amounts may contribute a bitter chocolate complexity. English
        hop flavor moderate to none. Medium-low to medium hop bitterness will vary
        the balance from slightly malty to slightly bitter. Usually fairly well attenuated,
        although somewhat sweet versions exist. Diacetyl should be moderately low
        to none. Moderate to low fruity esters.Medium-light to medium body. Moderately
        low to moderately high carbonation.A fairly substantial English dark ale with
        restrained roasty characteristics. Originating in England, porter evolved
        from a blend of beers or gyles known as "Entire." A precursor to stout. Said
        to have been favored by porters and other physical laborers.

    ingredients: Pale ale malt, American hops (usually Northern Brewer, rather than
        citrusy varieties), small amounts of toasted malt and/or crystal malts. Lager
        yeast, however some strains (often with the mention of "California" in the
        name) work better than others at the warmer fermentation temperatures (55
        to 60F) used. Note that some German yeast strains produce inappropriate sulfury
        character. Water should have relatively low sulfate and low to moderate carbonate
        levels.
    name: California Common Beer
    notes: This style is narrowly defined around the prototypical Anchor Steam example.
        Superficially similar to an American pale or amber ale, yet differs in that
        the hop flavor/aroma is woody/minty rather than citrusy, malt flavors are
        toasty and caramelly, the hopping is always assertive, and a warm-fermented
        lager yeast is used.
    og_max: 1.054

    profile: Typically showcases the signature Northern Brewer hops (with woody, rustic
        or minty qualities) in moderate to high strength. Light fruitiness acceptable.
        Low to moderate caramel and/or toasty malt aromatics support the hops. No
        diacetyl.Medium amber to light copper color. Generally clear. Moderate off-white
        head with good retention.Moderately malty with a pronounced hop bitterness.
        The malt character is usually toasty (not roasted) and caramelly. Low to moderately
        high hop flavor, usually showing Northern Brewer qualities (woody, rustic,
        minty). Finish fairly dry and crisp, with a lingering hop bitterness and a
        firm, grainy malt flavor. Light fruity esters are acceptable, but otherwise
        clean. No diacetyl.Medium-bodied. Medium to medium-high carbonation.A lightly
        fruity beer with firm, grainy maltiness, interesting toasty and caramel flavors,
        and showcasing the signature Northern Brewer varietal hop character. American
        West Coast original. Large shallow open fermenters (coolships) were traditionally
        used to compensate for the absence of refrigeration and to take advantage
        of the cool ambient temperatures in the San Francisco Bay area. Fermented
        with a lager yeast, but one that was selected to thrive at the cool end of
        normal ale fermentation temperatures.

    ingredients: Generally ales, although some dark strong lagers exist. Spices are
        required, and often include those evocative of the Christmas season (e.g.,
        allspice, nutmeg, cinnamon, cloves, ginger) but any combination is possible
        and creativity is encouraged. Fruit peel (e.g., oranges, lemon) may be used,
        as may subtle additions of other fruits. May use a wide range of crystal-type
        malts, particularly those that add dark fruit or caramel flavors. Flavorful
        adjuncts are often used (e.g., molasses, treacle, invert sugar, brown sugar,
        honey, maple syrup, etc.).
    name: Christmas/Winter Specialty Spiced Beer
    notes: Overall balance is the key to presenting a well-made Christmas beer. The
        special ingredients should complement the base beer and not overwhelm it.
        The brewer should recognize that some combinations of base beer styles and
        special ingredients work well together while others do not make for harmonious
        combinations. THE ENTRANT MAY DECLARE AN UNDERLYING BEER STYLE AS WELL AS
        THE SPECIAL INGREDIENTS USED. THE BASE STYLE, SPICES OR OTHER INGREDIENTS
        NEED NOT BE IDENTIFIED. THE BEER MUST INCLUDE SPICES AND MAY INCLUDE OTHER
        FERMENTABLES (SUGARS, HONEY, MAPLE SYRUP, MOLASSES, TREACLE, ETC.) OR FRUIT.
        If the base beer is a classic style, the original style should come through
        in aroma and flavor. Whenever spices, herbs or additional fermentables are
        declared, each should be noticeable and distinctive in its own way (although
        not necessarily individually identifiable; balanced with the other ingredients
        is still critical). English-style Winter Warmers (some of which may be labeled
        Christmas Ales) are generally not spiced, and should be entered as Old Ales.
        Belgian-style Christmas ales should be entered as Belgian Specialty Ales (16E).
    og_max: 1.2
    og_min: 1.0
    profile: A wide range of aromatics is possible, although many examples are reminiscent
        of Christmas cookies, gingerbread, English-type Christmas pudding, spruce
        trees, or mulling spices. Any combination of aromatics that suggests the holiday
        season is welcome. The base beer style often has a malty profile that supports
        the balanced presentation of the aromatics from spices and possibly other
        special ingredients. Additional fermentables (e.g., honey, molasses, maple
        syrup, etc.) may lend their own unique aromatics. Hop aromatics are often
        absent, subdued, or slightly spicy. Some fruit character (often of dried citrus
        peel, or dried fruit such as raisins or plums) is optional but acceptable.
        Alcohol aromatics may be found in some examples, but this character should
        be restrained. The overall aroma should be balanced and harmonious, and is
        often fairly complex and inviting.Generally medium amber to very dark brown
        (darker versions are more common). Usually clear, although darker versions
        may be virtually opaque. Some chill haze is acceptable. Generally has a well-formed
        head that is often off-white to tan.Many interpretations are possible; allow
        for brewer creativity as long as the resulting product is balanced and provides
        some spice presentation. Spices associated with the holiday season are typical
        (as mentioned in the Aroma section). The spices and optional fermentables
        should be supportive and blend well with the base beer style. Rich, malty
        and/or sweet malt-based flavors are common, and may include caramel, toast,
        nutty, or chocolate flavors. May include some dried fruit or dried fruit peel
        flavors such as raisin, plum, fig, orange peel or lemon peel. May include
        distinctive flavors from specific fermentables (molasses, honey, brown sugar,
        etc.), although these elements are not required. A light spruce or other evergreen
        tree character is optional but found in some examples. The wide range of special
        ingredients should be supportive and balanced, not so prominent as to overshadow
        the base beer. Bitterness and hop flavor are generally restrained so as to
        not interfere with the spices and special ingredients. Generally finishes
        rather full and satisfying, and often has some alcohol flavor. Roasted malt
        characteristics are rare, and not usually stronger than chocolate.A wide range
        of interpretations is possible. Body is generally medium to full, and a certain
        malty chewiness is often present. Moderately low to moderately high carbonation
        is typical. Many examples will show some well-aged, warming alcohol content,
        but without being overly hot. The beers do not have to be overly strong to
        show some warming effects.A stronger, darker, spiced beer that often has a
        rich body and warming finish suggesting a good accompaniment for the cold
        winter season. Throughout history, beer of a somewhat higher alcohol content
        and richness has been enjoyed during the winter holidays, when old friends
        get together to enjoy the season. Many breweries produce unique seasonal offerings
        that may be darker, stronger, spiced, or otherwise more characterful than
        their normal beers. Spiced versions are an American or Belgian tradition,
        since English or German breweries traditionally do not use spices in their
        beer.

    ingredients: Six-row barley with 20% to 30% flaked maize to dilute the excessive

        noble hops, or modern noble crosses (Ultra, Liberty, Crystal) are also appropriate.
        Modern American hops such as Cascade are inappropriate. Water with a high
        mineral content can lead to an inappropriate coarseness in flavor and harshness
        in aftertaste.
    name: Classic American Pilsner
    notes: The classic American Pilsner was brewed both pre-Prohibition and post-Prohibition
        with some differences. OGs of 1.050-1.060 would have been appropriate for
        pre-Prohibition beers while gravities dropped to 1.044-1.048 after Prohibition.
        Corresponding IBUs dropped from a pre-Prohibition level of 30-40 to 25-30

    profile: Low to medium grainy, corn-like or sweet maltiness may be evident (although
        rice-based beers are more neutral). Medium to moderately high hop aroma, often
        classic noble hops. Clean lager character, with no fruitiness or diacetyl.
        Some DMS is acceptable.Yellow to deep gold color. Substantial, long lasting
        white head. Bright clarity.Moderate to moderately high maltiness similar in
        character to the Continental Pilsners but somewhat lighter in intensity due
        to the use of up to 30% flaked maize (corn) or rice used as an adjunct. Slight
        grainy, corn-like sweetness from the use of maize with substantial offsetting
        hop bitterness. Rice-based versions are crisper, drier, and often lack corn-like
        flavors. Medium to high hop flavor from noble hops (either late addition or
        first-wort hopped). Medium to high hop bitterness, which should not be coarse
        nor have a harsh aftertaste. No fruitiness or diacetyl. Should be smooth and
        well-lagered.Medium body and rich, creamy mouthfeel. Medium to high carbonation
        levels.A substantial Pilsner that can stand up to the classic European Pilsners,
        but exhibiting the native American grains and hops available to German brewers
        who initially brewed it in the USA.  Refreshing, but with the underlying malt
        and hops that stand out when compared to other modern American light lagers.
        Maize lends a distinctive grainy sweetness. Rice contributes a crisper, more
        neutral character. A version of Pilsner brewed in the USA by immigrant German
        brewers who brought the process and yeast with them when they settled in America.
        They worked with the ingredients that were native to America to create a unique
        version of the original Pilsner. This style died out after Prohibition but
        was resurrected as a home-brewed style by advocates of the hobby.

    ingredients: American ingredients most commonly used. A grain bill of six-row
        malt, or a combination of six-row and North American two-row, is common. Adjuncts
        can include up to 20% flaked maize in the mash, and up to 20% glucose or other
        sugars in the boil. Soft water preferred. Any variety of hops can be used
        for bittering and finishing.
    name: Cream Ale
    notes: Classic American (i.e., pre-prohibition) Cream Ales were slightly stronger,
        hoppier (including some dry hopping) and more bitter (25-30+ IBUs). These
        versions should be entered in the specialty/experimental category. Most commercial
        examples are in the 1.050-1.053 OG range, and bitterness rarely rises above
        20 IBUs.

    ingredients: Standard description applies. Cyser is a standard mead made with
        the addition of apples or apple juice. Traditionally, cysers are made by the
        addition of honey to apple juice without additional water. A spiced cyser,
        or a cyser with other ingredients, should be entered as an Open Category Mead.
    name: Cyser
    notes: There should be an appealing blend of the fruit and honey character but
        not necessarily an even balance. Generally a good tannin-sweetness balance
        is desired, though very dry and very sweet examples do exist. See standard
        description for entrance requirements. Entrants MUST specify carbonation level,
        strength, and sweetness. Entrants MAY specify honey varieties. Entrants MAY
        specify the varieties of apple used; if specified, a varietal character will
        be expected. Products with a relatively low proportion of honey are better
        entered as a Specialty Cider.

    profile: ' A Cyser is a melomel made with apples (generally cider). Depending
        on the sweetness and strength, a subtle to distinctly identifiable honey and
        apple/cider character (dry and/or hydromel versions will tend to have lower
        aromatics than sweet and/or sack versions). The apple/cider character should
        be clean and distinctive; it can express a range of apple-based character
        ranging from a subtle fruitiness to a single varietal apple character (if
        declared) to a complex blend of apple aromatics. Some spicy or earthy notes
        may be present, as may a slightly sulfury character. The honey aroma should
        be noticeable, and can have a light to significant sweetness that may express
        the aroma of flower nectar. If a variety of honey is declared, the aroma might
        have a subtle to very noticeable varietal character reflective of the honey
        (different varieties have different intensities and characters). The bouquet
        should show a pleasant fermentation character, with clean and fresh aromatics
        being preferred. Stronger and/or sweeter versions will have higher alcohol
        and sweetness in the nose. Slight spicy phenolics from certain apple varieties
        are acceptable, as is a light diacetyl character from malolactic fermentation
        (both are optional). Standard description applies for remainder of characteristics.Standard
        description applies, except with regard to color. Color may range from pale
        straw to deep golden amber (most are yellow to gold), depending on the variety
        of honey and blend of apples or ciders used.The apple and honey flavor intensity
        may vary from none to high; the residual sweetness may vary from none to high;
        and the finish may range from dry to sweet, depending on what sweetness level
        has been declared (dry to sweet) and strength level has been declared (hydromel
        to sack). Natural acidity and tannin in apples may give some tartness and
        astringency to balance the sweetness, honey flavor and alcohol. A cyser may
        have a subtle to strong honey character, and may feature noticeable to prominent
        varietal character if a varietal honey is declared (different varieties have
        different intensities). Slight spicy phenolics from certain apple varieties
        are acceptable, as are a light diacetyl character from malolactic fermentation
        and a slight sulfur character (all are optional). Standard description applies
        for remainder of characteristics.Standard description applies. Often wine-like.
        Some natural acidity is usually present (from the blend of apples) and helps
        balance the overall impression. Some apples can provide natural astringency,
        but this character should not be excessive.In well-made examples of the style,
        the fruit is both distinctive and well-incorporated into the honey-sweet-acid-tannin-alcohol
        balance of the mead. Some of the best strong examples have the taste and aroma
        of an aged Calvados (apple brandy from northern France), while subtle, dry
        versions can taste similar to many fine white wines. '

        versions, and may be a bit drier, hoppier and more bitter. While most traditional
        examples are in the ranges cited, the style can be considered to have no upper
        limit for gravity, alcohol and bitterness (thus providing a home for very
        strong lagers). Any fruitiness is due to Munich and other specialty malts,
        not yeast-derived esters developed during fermentation.

        Hop bitterness varies from moderate to moderately low but always allows malt
        to dominate the flavor. Most versions are fairly sweet, but should have an
        impression of attenuation. The sweetness comes from low hopping, not from

        well attenuated than modern interpretations, with consequently higher sweetness
        and lower alcohol levels (and hence was considered "liquid bread" by the monks).
        The term "doppel (double) bock" was coined by Munich consumers. Many doppelbocks
        have names ending in "-ator," either as a tribute to the prototypical Salvator
        or to take advantage of the beer''s popularity.'

    ingredients: The dryness comes from the use of roasted unmalted barley in addition
        to pale malt, moderate to high hop bitterness, and good attenuation. Flaked
        unmalted barley may also be used to add creaminess. A small percentage (perhaps
        3%) of soured beer is sometimes added for complexity (generally by Guinness
        only). Water typically has moderate carbonate hardness, although high levels
        will not give the classic dry finish.
    name: Dry Stout
    notes: This is the draught version of what is otherwise known as Irish stout or
        Irish dry stout. Bottled versions are typically brewed from a significantly
        higher OG and may be designated as foreign extra stouts (if sufficiently strong).
        While most commercial versions rely primarily on roasted barley as the dark
        grain, others use chocolate malt, black malt or combinations of the three.
        The level of bitterness is somewhat variable, as is the roasted character
        and the dryness of the finish; allow for interpretation by brewers.

        on the success of London porters, but originally reflected a fuller, creamier,
        more "stout" body and strength. When a brewery offered a stout and a porter,
        the stout was always the stronger beer (it was originally called a "Stout
        Porter"). Modern versions are brewed from a lower OG and no longer reflect
        a higher strength than porters.

    ingredients: By German law, at least 50% of the grist must be malted wheat, although
        some versions use up to 70%; the remainder is usually Munich and/or Vienna
        malt. A traditional decoction mash gives the appropriate body without cloying
        sweetness. Weizen ale yeasts produce the typical spicy and fruity character,
        although extreme fermentation temperatures can affect the balance and produce
        off-flavors. A small amount of noble hops are used only for bitterness.
    name: Dunkelweizen
    notes: 'The presence of Munich and/or Vienna-type barley malts gives this style

    profile: Moderate to strong phenols (usually clove) and fruity esters (usually
        banana). The balance and intensity of the phenol and ester components can
        vary but the best examples are reasonably balanced and fairly prominent. Optionally,
        a low to moderate vanilla character and/or low bubblegum notes may be present,
        but should not dominate. Noble hop character ranges from low to none. A light
        to moderate wheat aroma (which might be perceived as bready or grainy) may
        be present and is often accompanied by a caramel, bread crust, or richer malt
        aroma (e.g., from Vienna and/or Munich malt). Any malt character is supportive
        and does not overpower the yeast character. No diacetyl or DMS. A light tartness
        is optional but acceptable.Light copper to mahogany brown in color. A very
        thick, moussy, long-lasting off-white head is characteristic. The high protein
        content of wheat impairs clarity in this traditionally unfiltered style, although
        the level of haze is somewhat variable. The suspended yeast sediment (which
        should be roused before drinking) also contributes to the cloudiness.Low to
        moderately strong banana and clove flavor. The balance and intensity of the
        phenol and ester components can vary but the best examples are reasonably
        balanced and fairly prominent.  Optionally, a very light to moderate vanilla
        character and/or low bubblegum notes can accentuate the banana flavor, sweetness
        and roundness; neither should be dominant if present. The soft, somewhat bready
        or grainy flavor of wheat is complementary, as is a richer caramel and/or
        melanoidin character from Munich and/or Vienna malt. The malty richness can
        be low to medium-high, but shouldn't overpower the yeast character. A roasted
        malt character is inappropriate. Hop flavor is very low to none, and hop bitterness
        is very low to low. A tart, citrusy character from yeast and high carbonation
        is sometimes present, but typically muted. Well rounded, flavorful, often
        somewhat sweet palate with a relatively dry finish. No diacetyl or DMS.Medium-light
        to medium-full body. The texture of wheat as well as yeast in suspension imparts
        the sensation of a fluffy, creamy fullness that may progress to a lighter
        finish, aided by moderate to high carbonation. The presence of Munich and/or
        Vienna malts also provide an additional sense of richness and fullness. Effervescent.A
        moderately dark, spicy, fruity, malty, refreshing wheat-based ale. Reflecting
        the best yeast and wheat character of a hefeweizen blended with the malty
        richness of a Munich dunkel. Old-fashioned Bavarian wheat beer was often dark.
        In the 1950s and 1960s, wheat beers did not have a youthful image, since most
        older people drank them for their health-giving qualities. Today, the lighter
        hefeweizen is more common.

    notes: Eisbocks are not simply stronger doppelbocks; the name refers to the process
        of freezing and concentrating the beer. Some doppelbocks are stronger than
        Eisbocks. Extended lagering is often needed post-freezing to smooth the alcohol

    profile: Very rich and strongly malty, often with a caramel-like aroma. May have
        moderate to strong fruitiness, often with a dried-fruit character. English
        hop aroma may range from mild to assertive. Alcohol aromatics may be low to
        moderate, but never harsh, hot or solventy. The intensity of these aromatics
        often subsides with age. The aroma may have a rich character including bready,
        toasty, toffee, molasses, and/or treacle notes. Aged versions may have a sherry-like
        quality, possibly vinous or port-like aromatics, and generally more muted
        malt aromas. Low to no diacetyl.Color may range from rich gold to very dark
        amber or even dark brown. Often has ruby highlights, but should not be opaque.
        Low to moderate off-white head; may have low head retention. May be cloudy
        with chill haze at cooler temperatures, but generally clears to good to brilliant
        clarity as it warms. The color may appear to have great depth, as if viewed
        through a thick glass lens. High alcohol and viscosity may be visible in "legs"
        when beer is swirled in a glass.Strong, intense, complex, multi-layered malt
        flavors ranging from bready and biscuity through nutty, deep toast, dark caramel,
        toffee, and/or molasses. Moderate to high malty sweetness on the palate, although
        the finish may be moderately sweet to moderately dry (depending on aging).
        Some oxidative or vinous flavors may be present, and often complex alcohol
        flavors should be evident. Alcohol flavors shouldn't be harsh, hot or solventy.
        Moderate to fairly high fruitiness, often with a dried-fruit character. Hop
        bitterness may range from just enough for balance to a firm presence; balance
        therefore ranges from malty to somewhat bitter. Low to moderately high hop
        flavor (usually UK varieties). Low to no diacetyl.Full-bodied and chewy, with
        a velvety, luscious texture (although the body may decline with long conditioning).
        A smooth warmth from aged alcohol should be present, and should not be hot
        or harsh. Carbonation may be low to moderate, depending on age and conditioning.The
        richest and strongest of the English Ales. A showcase of malty richness and
        complex, intense flavors. The character of these ales can change significantly
        over time; both young and old versions should be appreciated for what they
        are. The malt profile can vary widely; not all examples will have all possible
        flavors or aromas. the strongest ale offered by a brewery, and in recent years
        many commercial examples are now vintage-dated. Normally aged significantly
        prior to release. Often associated with the winter or holiday season.

    ingredients: Pale ale malt (well-modified and suitable for single-temperature
        infusion mashing,'); English hops; English yeast that can give a fruity or
        sulfury/minerally profile. Refined sugar may be used in some versions. High
        sulfate and low carbonate water is essential to achieving a pleasant hop bitterness
        in authentic Burton versions, although not all examples will exhibit the strong
        sulfate character.
    name: English IPA
    notes: A pale ale brewed to an increased gravity and hop rate. Modern versions
        of English IPAs generally pale in comparison (pun intended) to their ancestors.
        The term "IPA" is loosely applied in commercial English beers today, and has
        been (incorrectly) used in beers below 4% ABV. Generally will have more finish
        hops and less fruitiness and/or caramel than English pale ales and bitters.
        Fresher versions will obviously have a more significant finishing hop character.
    og_max: 1.075
    og_min: 1.05
    profile: A moderate to moderately high hop aroma of floral, earthy or fruity nature
        is typical, although the intensity of hop character is usually lower than
        American versions. A slightly grassy dry-hop aroma is acceptable, but not
        required. A moderate caramel-like or toasty malt presence is common. Low to
        moderate fruitiness, either from esters or hops, can be present. Some versions
        may have a sulfury note, although this character is not mandatory.Color ranges
        from golden amber to light copper, but most are pale to medium amber with
        an orange-ish tint. Should be clear, although unfiltered dry-hopped versions
        may be a bit hazy. Good head stand with off-white color should persist.Hop
        flavor is medium to high, with a moderate to assertive hop bitterness. The
        hop flavor should be similar to the aroma (floral, earthy, fruity, and/or
        slightly grassy). Malt flavor should be medium-low to medium-high, but should
        be noticeable, pleasant, and support the hop aspect. The malt should show
        an English character and be somewhat bready, biscuit-like, toasty, toffee-like
        and/or caramelly. Despite the substantial hop character typical of these beers,
        sufficient malt flavor, body and complexity to support the hops will provide
        the best balance. Very low levels of diacetyl are acceptable, and fruitiness
        from the fermentation or hops adds to the overall complexity. Finish is medium
        to dry, and bitterness may linger into the aftertaste but should not be harsh.
        If high sulfate water is used, a distinctively minerally, dry finish, some
        sulfur flavor, and a lingering bitterness are usually present. Some clean
        alcohol flavor can be noted in stronger versions. Oak is inappropriate in
        this style.Smooth, medium-light to medium-bodied mouthfeel without hop-derived
        astringency, although moderate to medium-high carbonation can combine to render
        an overall dry sensation in the presence of malt sweetness. Some smooth alcohol
        warming can and should be sensed in stronger (but not all) versions.A hoppy,
        moderately strong pale ale that features characteristics consistent with the
        use of English malt, hops and yeast. Has less hop character and a more pronounced
        malt flavor than American versions. Brewed to survive the voyage from England
        to India. The temperature extremes and rolling of the seas resulted in a highly
        attenuated beer upon arrival. English pale ales were derived from India Pale
        Ales.

    ingredients: Pale ale, amber, and/or crystal malts, may use a touch of black malt
        for color adjustment. May use sugar adjuncts, corn or wheat. English hops

        versions use medium to high sulfate water.
    name: Extra Special/Strong Bitter (English Pale Ale)
    notes: More evident malt and hop flavors than in a special or best bitter. Stronger
        versions may overlap somewhat with old ales, although strong bitters will
        tend to be paler and more bitter. Fuller's ESB is a unique beer with a very
        large, complex malt profile not found in other examples; most strong bitters
        are fruitier and hoppier. Judges should not judge all beers in this style
        as if they were Fuller's ESB clones. Some modern English variants are brewed
        exclusively with pale malt and are known as golden or summer bitters. Most
        bottled or kegged versions of UK-produced bitters are higher-alcohol versions
        of their cask (draught) products produced specifically for export. The IBU
        levels are often not adjusted, so the versions available in the US often do
        not directly correspond to their style subcategories in Britain. English pale
        ales are generally considered a premium, export-strength pale, bitter beer
        that roughly approximates a strong bitter, although reformulated for bottling
        (including containing higher carbonation).

        to deep copper. Good to brilliant clarity. Low to moderate white to off-white
        head. A low head is acceptable when carbonation is also low.Medium-high to
        medium bitterness with supporting malt flavors evident. Normally has a moderately
        low to somewhat strong caramelly malt sweetness. Hop flavor moderate to moderately
        high (any variety, although earthy, resiny, and/or floral UK hops are most
        traditional). Hop bitterness and flavor should be noticeable, but should not
        totally dominate malt flavors. May have low levels of secondary malt flavors
        (e.g., nutty, biscuity) adding complexity. Moderately-low to high fruity esters.
        Optionally may have low amounts of alcohol, and up to a moderate minerally/sulfury
        flavor. Medium-dry to dry finish (particularly if sulfate water is used).
        Generally no diacetyl, although very low levels are allowed.Medium-light to
        medium-full body. Low to moderate carbonation, although bottled commercial
        versions will be higher. Stronger versions may have a slight alcohol warmth
        but this character should not be too high.An average-strength to moderately-strong
        English ale. The balance may be fairly even between malt and hops to somewhat
        bitter. Drinkability is a critical component of the style; emphasis is still
        on the bittering hop addition as opposed to the aggressive middle and late
        hopping seen in American ales. A rather broad style that allows for considerable
        interpretation by the brewer. Strong bitters can be seen as a higher-gravity
        version of best bitters (although not necessarily "more premium" since best
        bitters are traditionally the brewer's finest product). Since beer is sold
        by strength in the UK, these beers often have some alcohol flavor (perhaps
        to let the consumer know they are getting their due). In England today, "ESB"
        is a brand unique to Fullers; in America, the name has been co-opted to describe
        a malty, bitter, reddish, standard-strength (for the US) English-type ale.
        Hopping can be English or a combination of English and American.

    ingredients: A base of Pils malt with judicious amounts of dark cara malts and
        a tiny bit of black or roast malt. Often includes maize. Low alpha acid continental
        hops are typical (avoid high alpha or distinctive American hops). Saccharomyces
        and Lactobacillus (and acetobacter) contribute to the fermentation and eventual
        flavor. Lactobacillus reacts poorly to elevated levels of alcohol. A sour
        mash or acidulated malt may also be used to develop the sour character without
        introducing Lactobacillus. Water high in carbonates is typical of its home
        region and will buffer the acidity of darker malts and the lactic sourness.
        Magnesium in the water accentuates the sourness.
    name: Flanders Brown Ale/Oud Bruin
    notes: Long aging and blending of young and aged beer may occur, adding smoothness
        and complexity and balancing any harsh, sour character. A deeper malt character
        distinguishes these beers from Flanders red ales. This style was designed
        to lay down so examples with a moderate aged character are considered superior
        to younger examples. As in fruit lambics, Oud Bruin can be used as a base
        for fruit-flavored beers such as kriek (cherries) or frambozen (raspberries),
        though these should be entered in the classic-style fruit beer category. The
        Oud Bruin is less acetic and maltier than a Flanders Red, and the fruity flavors
        are more malt-oriented.

    profile: Complex combination of fruity esters and rich malt character. Esters
        commonly reminiscent of raisins, plums, figs, dates, black cherries or prunes.
        A malt character of caramel, toffee, orange, treacle or chocolate is also
        common. Spicy phenols can be present in low amounts for complexity. A sherry-like
        character may be present and generally denotes an aged example. A low sour
        aroma may be present, and can modestly increase with age but should not grow
        to a noticeable acetic/vinegary character. Hop aroma absent. Diacetyl is perceived
        only in very minor quantities, if at all, as a complementary aroma.Dark reddish-brown
        to brown in color. Good clarity. Average to good head retention. Ivory to
        light tan head color.Malty with fruity complexity and some caramelization
        character. Fruitiness commonly includes dark fruits such as raisins, plums,
        figs, dates, black cherries or prunes. A malt character of caramel, toffee,
        orange, treacle or chocolate is also common. Spicy phenols can be present
        in low amounts for complexity. A slight sourness often becomes more pronounced
        in well-aged examples, along with some sherry-like character, producing a
        "sweet-and-sour" profile. The sourness should not grow to a notable acetic/vinegary
        character. Hop flavor absent. Restrained hop bitterness. Low oxidation is
        appropriate as a point of complexity. Diacetyl is perceived only in very minor
        quantities, if at all, as a complementary flavor.Medium to medium-full body.
        Low to moderate carbonation. No astringency with a sweet and tart finish.A
        malty, fruity, aged, somewhat sour Belgian-style brown ale. An "old ale" tradition,
        indigenous to East Flanders, typified by the products of the Liefman brewery
        (now owned by Riva), which has roots back to the 1600s. Historically brewed
        as a "provision beer" that would develop some sourness as it aged. These beers
        were typically more sour than current commercial examples. While Flanders
        red beers are aged in oak, the brown beers are warm aged in stainless steel.

    ingredients: A base of Vienna and/or Munich malts, light to medium cara-malts,
        and a small amount of Special B are used with up to 20% maize. Low alpha acid
        continental hops are commonly used (avoid high alpha or distinctive American
        hops). Saccharomyces, Lactobacillus and Brettanomyces (and acetobacter) contribute
        to the fermentation and eventual flavor.
    name: Flanders Red Ale
    notes: Long aging and blending of young and well-aged beer often occurs, adding
        to the smoothness and complexity, though the aged product is sometimes released
        as a connoisseur's beer. Known as the Burgundy of Belgium, it is more wine-like
        than any other beer style. The reddish color is a product of the malt although
        an extended, less-than-rolling portion of the boil may help add an attractive
        Burgundy hue. Aging will also darken the beer. The Flanders red is more acetic
        and the fruity flavors more reminiscent of a red wine than an Oud Bruin. Can
        have an apparent attenuation of up to 98%.
    og_max: 1.057

    profile: Complex fruitiness with complementary malt. Fruitiness is high, and reminiscent
        of black cherries, oranges, plums or red currants. There is often some vanilla
        and/or chocolate notes. Spicy phenols can be present in low amounts for complexity.
        The sour, acidic aroma ranges from complementary to intense. No hop aroma.
        Diacetyl is perceived only in very minor quantities, if at all, as a complementary
        aroma.Deep red, burgundy to reddish-brown in color. Good clarity. White to
        very pale tan head. Average to good head retention.Intense fruitiness commonly
        includes plum, orange, black cherry or red currant flavors. A mild vanilla
        and/or chocolate character is often present. Spicy phenols can be present
        in low amounts for complexity. Sour, acidic character ranges from complementary
        to intense. Malty flavors range from complementary to prominent. Generally
        as the sour character increases, the sweet character blends to more of a background
        flavor (and vice versa). No hop flavor. Restrained hop bitterness. An acidic,
        tannic bitterness is often present in low to moderate amounts, and adds an
        aged red wine-like character with a long, dry finish. Diacetyl is perceived
        only in very minor quantities, if at all, as a complementary flavor.Medium
        bodied. Low to medium carbonation. Low to medium astringency, like a well-aged
        red wine, often with a prickly acidity. Deceivingly light and crisp on the
        palate although a somewhat sweet finish is not uncommon.A complex, sour, red
        wine-like Belgian-style ale. The indigenous beer of West Flanders, typified
        by the products of the Rodenbach brewery, established in 1820 in West Flanders
        but reflective of earlier brewing traditions. The beer is aged for up to two
        years, often in huge oaken barrels which contain the resident bacteria necessary
        to sour the beer. It was once common in Belgium and England to blend old beer
        with young to balance the sourness and acidity found in aged beer. While blending
        of batches for consistency is now common among larger breweries, this type
        of blending is a fading art.

        Stout; this type of beer is best entered as a Specialty Beer - Category 23).
        Think of the style as either a scaled-up dry and/or sweet stout, or a scaled-down
        Imperial stout without the late hops. Highly bitter and hoppy versions are
        best entered as American-style Stouts (13E).

    profile: Roasted grain aromas moderate to high, and can have coffee, chocolate
        and/or lightly burnt notes. Fruitiness medium to high. Some versions may have
        a sweet aroma, or molasses, licorice, dried fruit, and/or vinous aromatics.
        Stronger versions can have the aroma of alcohol (never sharp, hot, or solventy).
        Hop aroma low to none. Diacetyl low to none.Very deep brown to black in color.
        Clarity usually obscured by deep color (if not opaque, should be clear). Large
        tan to brown head with good retention.Tropical versions can be quite sweet
        without much roast or bitterness, while export versions can be moderately
        dry (reflecting impression of a scaled-up version of either sweet stout or
        dry stout). Roasted grain and malt character can be moderate to high, although
        sharpness of dry stout will not be present in any example. Tropical versions
        can have high fruity esters, smooth dark grain flavors, and restrained bitterness;
        they often have a sweet, rum-like quality. Export versions tend to have lower
        esters, more assertive roast flavors, and higher bitterness. The roasted flavors
        of either version may taste of coffee, chocolate, or lightly burnt grain.
        Little to no hop flavor. Very low to no diacetyl.Medium-full to full body,
        often with a smooth, creamy character. May give a warming (but never hot)
        impression from alcohol presence. Moderate to moderately-high carbonation.A
        very dark, moderately strong, roasty ale. Tropical varieties can be quite
        sweet, while export versions can be drier and fairly robust. Originally high-gravity
        stouts brewed for tropical markets (and hence, sometimes known as "Tropical
        Stouts"). Some bottled export (i.e., stronger) versions of dry or sweet stout
        also fit this profile. Guinness Foreign Extra Stout has been made since the
        early 1800s.

    name: Fruit Beer
    notes: Overall balance is the key to presenting a well-made fruit beer. The fruit
        should complement the original style and not overwhelm it. The brewer should
        recognize that some combinations of base beer styles and fruits work well
        together while others do not make for harmonious combinations. THE ENTRANT
        MUST SPECIFY THE UNDERLYING BEER STYLE AS WELL AS THE TYPE OF FRUIT(S) USED.
        IF THIS BEER IS BASED ON A CLASSIC STYLE (E.G., BLONDE ALE) THEN THE SPECIFIC
        STYLE MUST BE SPECIFIED. CLASSIC STYLES DO NOT HAVE TO BE CITED (E.G., "PORTER"
        OR "WHEAT ALE" IS ACCEPTABLE). THE TYPE OF FRUIT(S) MUST ALWAYS BE SPECIFIED.
        If the base beer is a classic style, the original style should come through
        in aroma and flavor. Note that fruit-based lambics should be entered in the
        Fruit Lambic category (17F), while other fruit-based Belgian specialties should
        be entered in the Belgian Specialty Ale category (16E). Aged fruit may sometimes
        have flavor and aroma characteristics similar to Sauternes, Sherry or Tokaj,
        but a beer with a quality such as this should make a special claim (e.g.,
        amontillado, fino, botrytis). Beer with chile peppers should be entered in
        the Spice/Herb/Vegetable Beer category (21A).
    og_max: 1.2
    og_min: 1.0
    profile: 'The distinctive aromatics associated with the particular fruit(s) should
        be noticeable in the aroma; however, note that some fruit (e.g., raspberries,
        cherries) have stronger aromas and are more distinctive than others (e.g.,
        blueberries, strawberries) allow for a range of fruit character and intensity
        from subtle to aggressive. The fruit character should be pleasant and supportive,
        not artificial and inappropriately overpowering (considering the character
        of the fruit) nor should it have defects such as oxidation. As with all specialty
        beers, a proper fruit beer should be a harmonious balance of the featured
        fruit(s) with the underlying beer style. Aroma hops, yeast by-products and
        malt components of the underlying beer may not be as noticeable when fruit
        are present. These components (especially hops) may also be intentionally
        subdued to allow the fruit character to come through in the final presentation.
        If the base beer is an ale then a non-specific fruitiness and/or other fermentation
        by-products such as diacetyl may be present as appropriate for warmer fermentations.
        If the base beer is a lager, then overall less fermentation byproducts would
        be appropriate. Some malt aroma may be desirable, especially in dark styles.
        Hop aroma may be absent or balanced with fruit, depending on the style. The
        fruit should add an extra complexity to the beer, but not be so prominent
        as to unbalance the resulting presentation. Some tartness may be present if
        naturally occurring in the particular fruit(s), but should not be inappropriately
        intense.Appearance should be appropriate to the base beer being presented
        and will vary depending on the base beer. For lighter-colored beers with fruits
        that exhibit distinctive colors, the color should be noticeable. Note that
        the color of fruit in beer is often lighter than the flesh of the fruit itself
        and may take on slightly different shades. Fruit beers may have some haze
        or be clear, although haze is a generally undesirable. The head may take on
        some of the color of the fruit.As with aroma, the distinctive flavor character
        associated with the particular fruit(s) should be noticeable, and may range
        in intensity from subtle to aggressive. The balance of fruit with the underlying
        beer is vital, and the fruit character should not be so artificial and/or
        inappropriately overpowering as to suggest a fruit juice drink. Hop bitterness,
        flavor, malt flavors, alcohol content, and fermentation by-products, such
        as esters or diacetyl, should be appropriate to the base beer and be harmonious
        and balanced with the distinctive fruit flavors present. Note that these components
        (especially hops) may be intentionally subdued to allow the fruit character
        to come through in the final presentation. Some tartness may be present if
        naturally occurring in the particular fruit(s), but should not be inappropriately
        intense. Remember that fruit generally add flavor not sweetness to fruit beers.
        The sugar found in fruit is usually fully fermented and contributes to lighter
        flavors and a drier finish than might be expected for the declared base style.
        However, residual sweetness is not necessarily a negative characteristic unless
        it has a raw, unfermented quality.Mouthfeel may vary depending on the base
        beer selected and as appropriate to that base beer. Body and carbonation levels
        should be appropriate to the base beer style being presented. Fruit generally
        adds fermentables that tend to thin out the beer; the resulting beer may seem
        lighter than expected for the declared base style.A harmonious marriage of
        fruit and beer. The key attributes of the underlying style will be different
        with the addition of fruit; do not expect the base beer to taste the same
        as the unadulterated version. Judge the beer based on the pleasantness and
        balance of the resulting combination. '

        be present and must fit with the other fruits. It is a fault if the adjuncts
        completely dominate; a judge might ask, "Would this be different if neutral
        spirits replaced the cider?" A fruit cider should not be like an alco-pop.
        Oxidation is a fault.Substantial. May be significantly tannic depending on
        fruit added.Like a dry wine with complex flavors. The apple character must
        marry with the added fruit so that neither dominates the other. '

    ingredients: Unmalted wheat (30-40%), Pilsner malt and aged (surannes) hops (3
        years) are used. The aged hops are used more for preservative effects than
        bitterness, and makes actual bitterness levels difficult to estimate. Traditional
        products use 10-30% fruit (25%, if cherry). Fruits traditionally used include
        tart cherries (with pits), raspberries or Muscat grapes. More recent examples
        include peaches, apricots or merlot grapes. Tart or acidic fruit is traditionally
        used as its purpose is not to sweeten the beer but to add a new dimension.
        Traditionally these beers are spontaneously fermented with naturally-occurring
        yeast and bacteria in predominately oaken barrels. Home-brewed and craft-brewed
        versions are more typically made with pure cultures of yeast commonly including
        Saccharomyces, Brettanomyces, Pediococcus and Lactobacillus in an attempt
        to recreate the effects of the dominant microbiota of Brussels and the surrounding
        countryside of the Senne River valley. Cultures taken from bottles are sometimes
        used but there is no simple way of knowing what organisms are still viable.
    name: Fruit Lambic
    notes: Fruit-based lambics are often produced like gueuze by mixing one, two,
        and three-year old lambic. "Young" lambic contains fermentable sugars while
        old lambic has the characteristic "wild" taste of the Senne River valley.
        Fruit is commonly added halfway through aging and the yeast and bacteria will
        ferment all sugars from the fruit. Fruit may also be added to unblended lambic.
        The most traditional styles of fruit lambics include kriek (cherries), framboise
        (raspberries) and druivenlambik (muscat grapes). ENTRANT MUST SPECIFY THE
        TYPE OF FRUIT(S) USED IN MAKING THE LAMBIC. Any overly sweet lambics (e.g.,
        Lindemans or Belle Vue clones) would do better entered in the 16E Belgian
        Specialty category since this category does not describe beers with that character.
        IBUs are approximate since aged hops are used; Belgians use hops for anti-bacterial
        properties more than bittering in lambics.

    profile: The fruit which has been added to the beer should be the dominant aroma.
        A low to moderately sour/acidic character blends with aromas described as
        barnyard, earthy, goaty, hay, horsey, and horse blanket (and thus should be
        recognizable as a lambic). The fruit aroma commonly blends with the other
        aromas. An enteric, smoky, cigar-like, or cheesy aroma is unfavorable. No
        hop aroma. No diacetyl.The variety of fruit generally determines the color
        though lighter-colored fruit may have little effect on the color. The color
        intensity may fade with age. Clarity is often good, although some fruit will
        not drop bright. A thick rocky, mousse-like head, sometimes a shade of fruit,
        is generally long-lasting. Always effervescent.The fruit added to the beer
        should be evident. A low to moderate sour and more commonly (sometimes high)
        acidic character is present. The classic barnyard characteristics may be low
        to high. When young, the beer will present its full fruity taste. As it ages,
        the lambic taste will become dominant at the expense of the fruit character
        - thus fruit lambics are not intended for long aging. A low, complementary
        sweetness may be present, but higher levels are uncharacteristic. A mild vanilla
        and/or oak flavor is occasionally noticeable. An enteric, smoky or cigar-like
        character is undesirable. Hop bitterness is generally absent. No hop flavor.
        No diacetyl.Light to medium-light body. In spite of the low finishing gravity,
        the many mouth-filling flavors prevent the beer from tasting like water. Has
        a low to high tart, puckering quality without being sharply astringent. Some
        versions have a low warming character. Highly carbonated.Complex, fruity,
        pleasantly sour/acidic, balanced, pale, wheat-based ale fermented by a variety
        of Belgian microbiota. A lambic with fruit, not just a fruit beer. Spontaneously
        fermented sour ales from the area in and around Brussels (the Senne Valley)
        stem from a farmhouse brewing tradition several centuries old. Their numbers
        are constantly dwindling and some are untraditionally sweetening their products
        (post-fermentation) with sugar or sweet fruit to make them more palatable
        to a wider audience. Fruit was traditionally added to lambic or gueuze, either
        by the blender or publican, to increase the variety of beers available in
        local cafes.

    profile: Typically features a light grainy Pils malt character (sometimes Graham
        cracker-like) and distinctive flowery or spicy noble hops. Clean, no fruity
        esters, no diacetyl. May have an initial sulfury aroma (from water and/or

        are acceptable. Hop bitterness dominates taste and continues through the finish
        and lingers into the aftertaste. Hop flavor can range from low to high but
        should only be derived from German noble hops. Clean, no fruity esters, no

    notes: Gueuze is traditionally produced by mixing one, two, and three-year old

        characteristic "wild" taste of the Senne River valley. A good gueuze is not
        the most pungent, but possesses a full and tantalizing bouquet, a sharp aroma,
        and a soft, velvety flavor. Lambic is served uncarbonated, while gueuze is
        served effervescent. IBUs are approximate since aged hops are used; Belgians
        use hops for anti-bacterial properties more than bittering in lambics. Products

    ingredients: Pale ale malt (well-modified and suitable for single-temperature
        infusion mashing,'); can use a complex variety of hops (English, American,
        noble). American yeast that can give a clean or slightly fruity profile. Generally
        all-malt, but mashed at lower temperatures for high attenuation. Water character
        varies from soft to moderately sulfate.
    name: Imperial IPA
    notes: Bigger than either an English or American IPA in both alcohol strength
        and overall hop level (bittering and finish). Less malty, lower body, less
        rich and a greater overall hop intensity than an American Barleywine. Typically
        not as high in gravity/alcohol as a barleywine, since high alcohol and malt
        tend to limit drinkability. A showcase for hops.
    og_max: 1.09
    og_min: 1.07
    profile: A prominent to intense hop aroma that can be derived from American, English
        and/or noble varieties (although a citrusy hop character is almost always
        present). Most versions are dry hopped and can have an additional resinous
        or grassy aroma, although this is not absolutely required. Some clean malty
        sweetness may be found in the background. Fruitiness, either from esters or
        hops, may also be detected in some versions, although a neutral fermentation
        character is typical. Some alcohol can usually be noted, but it should not
        have a "hot" character.Color ranges from golden amber to medium reddish copper;
        some versions can have an orange-ish tint. Should be clear, although unfiltered
        dry-hopped versions may be a bit hazy. Good head stand with off-white color
        should persist.Hop flavor is strong and complex, and can reflect the use of
        American, English and/or noble hop varieties. High to absurdly high hop bitterness,
        although the malt backbone will generally support the strong hop character
        and provide the best balance. Malt flavor should be low to medium, and is
        generally clean and malty although some caramel or toasty flavors are acceptable
        at low levels. No diacetyl. Low fruitiness is acceptable but not required.
        A long, lingering bitterness is usually present in the aftertaste but should
        not be harsh. Medium-dry to dry finish. A clean, smooth alcohol flavor is
        usually present. Oak is inappropriate in this style. May be slightly sulfury,
        but most examples do not exhibit this character.Smooth, medium-light to medium
        body. No harsh hop-derived astringency, although moderate to medium-high carbonation
        can combine to render an overall dry sensation in the presence of malt sweetness.
        Smooth alcohol warming.An intensely hoppy, very strong pale ale without the
        big maltiness and/or deeper malt flavors of an American barleywine. Strongly
        hopped, but clean, lacking harshness, and a tribute to historical IPAs. Drinkability
        is an important characteristic; this should not be a heavy, sipping beer.
        It should also not have much residual sweetness or a heavy character grain
        profile. A recent American innovation reflecting the trend of American craft
        brewers "pushing the envelope" to satisfy the need of hop aficionados for
        increasingly intense products. The adjective "Imperial" is arbitrary and simply
        implies a stronger version of an IPA; "double," "extra," "extreme," or any
        other variety of adjectives would be equally valid.

    ingredients: Base of Pils and/or Vienna malt with some Munich malt to add character
        (although much less than in a traditional bock). No non-malt adjuncts. Noble
        hops. Soft water preferred so as to avoid harshness. Clean lager yeast. Decoction
        mash is typical, but boiling is less than in traditional bocks to restrain
        color development.
    name: Maibock/Helles Bock
    notes: "Can be thought of as either a pale version of a traditional bock, or a\
        \ Munich helles brewed to bock strength. While quite malty, this beer typically\
        \ has less dark and rich malt flavors than a traditional bock. May also be\
        \ drier, hoppier, and more bitter than a traditional bock. The hops compensate\
        \ for the lower level of melanoidins. There is some dispute whether Helles\
        \ (\"pale\") Bock and Mai (\"May\") Bock are synonymous. Most agree that they\
        \ are identical (as is the consensus for M\xE4rzen and Oktoberfest), but some\
        \ believe that Maibock is a \"fest\" type beer hitting the upper limits of\
        \ hopping and color for the range. Any fruitiness is due to Munich and other\
        \ specialty malts, not yeast-derived esters developed during fermentation."

    ingredients: Standard description applies. A metheglin is a standard mead made
        with the addition of spices or herbs. Meads made with flowers (such as rose
        petal mead, or rhodomel), chocolate, coffee, nuts or chile peppers (capsimel/capsicumel)
        may also be entered in this category, as can meads made with a blend of spices.
        If spices are used in conjunction with other ingredients such as fruit, cider,
        or other fermentables, then the mead should be entered as an Open Category
        Mead.
    name: Metheglin
    notes: Often, a blend of spices may give a character greater than the sum of its
        parts. The better examples of this style use spices/herbs subtly and when
        more than one are used, they are carefully selected so that they blend harmoniously.
        See standard description for entrance requirements. Entrants MUST specify
        carbonation level, strength, and sweetness. Entrants MAY specify honey varieties.
        Entrants MUST specify the types of spices used.

    profile: ' A Metheglin is a spiced mead. Depending on the sweetness and strength,
        a subtle to distinctly identifiable honey and herb/spice character (dry and/or
        hydromel versions will tend to have lower aromatics than sweet and/or sack
        versions). The herb/spice character should display distinctive aromatics associated
        with the particular herbs/spices; however, note that some herbs/spices (e.g.,
        ginger, cinnamon) have stronger aromas and are more distinctive than others
        (e.g., chamomile, lavender) allow for a range of herb/spice character and
        intensity from subtle to aggressive. The herb/spice character should be pleasant
        and supportive, not artificial and inappropriately overpowering (considering
        the character of the herb/spice). In a blended herb/spice metheglin, not all
        herbs/spices may be individually identifiable or of equal intensity. The honey
        aroma should be noticeable, and can have a light to significant sweetness
        that may express the aroma of flower nectar. If a variety of honey is declared,
        the aroma might have a subtle to very noticeable varietal character reflective
        of the honey (different varieties have different intensities and characters).
        The bouquet should show a pleasant fermentation character, with clean and
        fresh aromatics being preferred. Stronger and/or sweeter versions will have
        higher alcohol and sweetness in the nose. Some herbs and spices may produce
        spicy or peppery phenolics. Standard description applies for remainder of
        characteristics.Standard description applies, except perhaps to note that
        the color usually won''t be affected by spices and herbs (although flowers,
        petals and peppers may provide subtle colors; tea blends may provide significant
        colors).The herb/spice flavor intensity may vary from subtle to high; the
        honey flavor intensity may vary from subtle to high; the residual sweetness
        may vary from none to high; and the finish may range from dry to sweet, depending
        on what sweetness level has been declared (dry to sweet) and strength level
        has been declared (hydromel to sack). The distinctive flavor character associated
        with the particular herbs/spices may range in intensity from subtle to aggressive
        (although some herbs/spices may not be individually recognizable, and can
        just serve to add a background complexity). Certain herbs and spices might
        add bitter, astringent, phenolic or spicy (hot) flavors; if present, these
        qualities should be related to the declared ingredients (otherwise, they are
        faults), and they should balance and blend with the honey, sweetness and alcohol.
        Metheglins containing more than one herb/spice should have a good balance
        among the different herbs/spices, though some herbs/spices will tend to dominate
        the flavor profile. A metheglin may have a subtle to strong honey character,
        and may feature noticeable to prominent varietal character if a varietal honey
        is declared (different varieties have different intensities). Standard description
        applies for remainder of characteristics.Standard description applies. Some
        herbs or spices may contain tannins that add a bit of body and some astringency,
        but this character should not be excessive.In well-made examples of the style,
        the herbs/spices are both distinctive and well-incorporated into the honey-sweet-acid-tannin-alcohol
        balance of the mead. Different types of herbs/spices can result in widely
        different characteristics; allow for a variation in the final product. '

    profile: Low to moderate malt aroma, and may have some fruitiness. The malt expression

        toasted, nutty, chocolate, or lightly roasted. Little to no hop aroma. Very
        low to no diacetyl.Copper to dark brown or mahogany color. A few paler examples
        (medium amber to light brown) exist. Generally clear, although is traditionally
        unfiltered. Low to moderate off-white to tan head. Retention may be poor due
        to low carbonation, adjunct use and low gravity.Generally a malty beer, although
        may have a very wide range of malt- and yeast-based flavors (e.g., malty,
        sweet, caramel, toffee, toast, nutty, chocolate, coffee, roast, vinous, fruit,
        licorice, molasses, plum, raisin). Can finish sweet or dry. Versions with
        darker malts may have a dry, roasted finish. Low to moderate bitterness, enough
        to provide some balance but not enough to overpower the malt. Fruity esters
        moderate to none. Diacetyl and hop flavor low to none.Light to medium body.
        Generally low to medium-low carbonation. Roast-based versions may have a light
        astringency. Sweeter versions may seem to have a rather full mouthfeel for
        the gravity.A light-flavored, malt-accented beer that is readily suited to
        drinking in quantity. Refreshing, yet flavorful. Some versions may seem like
        lower gravity brown porters. May have evolved as one of the elements of early
        porters. In modern terms, the name "mild" refers to the relative lack of hop
        bitterness (i.e., less hoppy than a pale ale, and not so strong). Originally,
        the "mildness" may have referred to the fact that this beer was young and
        did not yet have the moderate sourness that aged batches had. Somewhat rare
        in England, good versions may still be found in the Midlands around Birmingham.

    ingredients: Grist is traditionally made up of German Munich malt (up to 100%
        in some cases) with the remainder German Pilsner malt. Small amounts of crystal
        malt can add dextrins and color but should not introduce excessive residual
        sweetness. Slight additions of roasted malts (such as Carafa or chocolate)
        may be used to improve color but should not add strong flavors. Noble German
        hop varieties and German lager yeast strains should be used. Moderately carbonate
        water. Often decoction mashed (up to a triple decoction) to enhance the malt
        flavors and create the depth of color.

    profile: Rich, Munich malt sweetness, like bread crusts (and sometimes toast.)
        Hints of chocolate, nuts, caramel, and/or toffee are also acceptable. No fruity

        tan head. Usually clear, although murky unfiltered versions exist.Dominated
        by the rich and complex flavor of Munich malt, usually with melanoidins reminiscent
        of bread crusts. The taste can be moderately sweet, although it should not
        be overwhelming or cloying. Mild caramel, chocolate, toast or nuttiness may
        be present. Burnt or bitter flavors from roasted malts are inappropriate,
        as are pronounced caramel flavors from crystal malt. Hop bitterness is moderately
        low but perceptible, with the balance tipped firmly towards maltiness. Noble
        hop flavor is low to none. Aftertaste remains malty, although the hop bitterness
        may become more apparent in the medium-dry finish. Clean lager character with
        no fruity esters or diacetyl.Medium to medium-full body, providing a firm
        and dextrinous mouthfeel without being heavy or cloying. Moderate carbonation.
        May have a light astringency and a slight alcohol warming.Characterized by
        depth and complexity of Munich malt and the accompanying melanoidins. Rich
        Munich flavors, but not as intense as a bock or as roasted as a schwarzbier.
        The classic brown lager style of Munich which developed as a darker, malt-accented
        beer in part because of the moderately carbonate water. While originating
        in Munich, the style has become very popular throughout Bavaria (especially
        Franconia).

    notes: Generally between sweet and dry stouts in sweetness. Variations exist,
        from fairly sweet to quite dry. The level of bitterness also varies, as does
        the oatmeal impression. Light use of oatmeal may give a certain silkiness
        of body and richness of flavor, while heavy use of oatmeal can be fairly intense
        in flavor with an almost oily mouthfeel. When judging, allow for differences

    ingredients: Grist varies, although German Vienna malt is often the backbone of
        the grain bill, with some Munich malt, Pils malt, and possibly some crystal
        malt. All malt should derive from the finest quality two-row barley. Continental
        hops, especially noble varieties, are most authentic. Somewhat alkaline water
        (up to 300 PPM), with significant carbonate content is welcome. A decoction
        mash can help develop the rich malt profile.
    name: "Oktoberfest/M\xE4rzen"
    notes: Domestic German versions tend to be golden, like a strong Pils-dominated
        Helles. Export German versions are typically orange-amber in color, and have
        a distinctive toasty malt character. German beer tax law limits the OG of
        the style at 14P since it is a vollbier, although American versions can be
        stronger. "Fest" type beers are special occasion beers that are usually stronger
        than their everyday counterparts.

    profile: Rich German malt aroma (of Vienna and/or Munich malt). A light to moderate
        toasted malt aroma is often present. Clean lager aroma with no fruity esters

        often includes a toasted aspect. Hop bitterness is moderate, and noble hop
        flavor is low to none. Balance is toward malt, though the finish is not sweet.
        Noticeable caramel or roasted flavors are inappropriate. Clean lager character

        carbonation. Smooth. Fully fermented, without a cloying finish.Smooth, clean,
        and rather rich, with a depth of malt character. This is one of the classic
        malty styles, with a maltiness that is often described as soft, complex, and
        elegant but never cloying. Origin is credited to Gabriel Sedlmayr, based on
        an adaptation of the Vienna style developed by Anton Dreher around 1840, shortly
        after lager yeast was first isolated. Typically brewed in the spring, signaling
        the end of the traditional brewing season and stored in cold caves or cellars
        during the warm summer months. Served in autumn amidst traditional celebrations.

    ingredients: Generous quantities of well-modified pale malt (generally English
        in origin, though not necessarily so), along with judicious quantities of
        caramel malts and other specialty character malts. Some darker examples suggest
        that dark malts (e.g., chocolate, black malt) may be appropriate, though sparingly
        so as to avoid an overly roasted character. Adjuncts (such as molasses, treacle,
        invert sugar or dark sugar) are often used, as are starchy adjuncts (maize,
        flaked barley, wheat) and malt extracts. Hop variety is not as important,
        as the relative balance and aging process negate much of the varietal character.
        British ale yeast that has low attenuation, but can handle higher alcohol
        levels, is traditional.
    name: Old Ale
    notes: Strength and character varies widely. Fits in the style space between normal
        gravity beers (strong bitters, brown porters) and barleywines. Can include
        winter warmers, strong dark milds, strong (and perhaps darker) bitters, blended
        strong beers (stock ale blended with a mild or bitter), and lower gravity
        versions of English barleywines. Many English examples, particularly winter
        warmers, are lower than 6% ABV.

    profile: Malty-sweet with fruity esters, often with a complex blend of dried-fruit,
        vinous, caramelly, molasses, nutty, toffee, treacle, and/or other specialty
        malt aromas. Some alcohol and oxidative notes are acceptable, akin to those
        found in Sherry or Port. Hop aromas not usually present due to extended aging.Light
        amber to very dark reddish-brown color (most are fairly dark). Age and oxidation
        may darken the beer further. May be almost opaque (if not, should be clear).
        Moderate to low cream- to light tan-colored head; may be adversely affected
        by alcohol and age.Medium to high malt character with a luscious malt complexity,
        often with nutty, caramelly and/or molasses-like flavors. Light chocolate
        or roasted malt flavors are optional, but should never be prominent. Balance
        is often malty-sweet, but may be well hopped (the impression of bitterness
        often depends on amount of aging). Moderate to high fruity esters are common,
        and may take on a dried-fruit or vinous character. The finish may vary from
        dry to somewhat sweet. Extended aging may contribute oxidative flavors similar
        to a fine old Sherry, Port or Madeira. Alcoholic strength should be evident,
        though not overwhelming. Diacetyl low to none. Some wood-aged or blended versions
        may have a lactic or Brettanomyces character; but this is optional and should
        not be too strong (enter as a specialty beer if it is).Medium to full, chewy
        body, although older examples may be lower in body due to continued attenuation
        during conditioning. Alcohol warmth is often evident and always welcome. Low
        to moderate carbonation, depending on age and conditioning.An ale of significant
        alcoholic strength, bigger than strong bitters and brown porters, though usually
        not as strong or rich as barleywine. Usually tilted toward a sweeter, maltier
        balance. "It should be a warming beer of the type that is best drunk in half
        pints by a warm fire on a cold winter's night" - Michael Jackson. A traditional
        English ale style, mashed at higher temperatures than strong ales to reduce
        attenuation, then aged at the brewery after primary fermentation (similar
        to the process used for historical porters). Often had age-related character
        (lactic, Brett, oxidation, leather) associated with "stale" beers. Used as
        stock ales for blending or enjoyed at full strength (stale or stock refers
        to beers that were aged or stored for a significant period of time). Winter
        warmers are a more modern style that are maltier, fuller-bodied, often darker
        beers that may be a brewery's winter seasonal special offering.

    profile: ' An Open Category Mead is a honey-based beverage that either combines
        ingredients from two or more of the other mead sub-categories, is a historical
        or indigenous mead (e.g., tej, Polish meads), or is a mead that does not fit
        into any other category. Any specialty or experimental mead using additional
        sources of fermentables (e.g., maple syrup, molasses, brown sugar, or agave
        nectar), additional ingredients (e.g., vegetables, liquors, smoke, etc.),
        alternative processes (e.g., icing, oak-aging) or other unusual ingredient,
        process, or technique would also be appropriate in this category. No mead
        can be "out of style" for this category unless it fits into another existing
        mead category. Aroma, appearance, flavor, mouthfeel generally follow the standard
        descriptions, yet note that all the characteristics may vary. Since a wide
        range of entries are possible, note that the characteristics may reflect combinations
        of the respective elements of the various sub-categories used in this style.
        Refer to Category 25 for a detailed description of the character of dry, semisweet
        and sweet mead. If the entered mead is a combination of other existing mead
        categories, refer to the constituent categories for a detailed description
        of the character of the component styles. This mead should exhibit the character
        of all of the ingredients in varying degrees, and should show a good blending
        or balance between the various flavor elements. Whatever ingredients are included,
        the result should be identifiable as a honey-based fermented beverage.'

    profile: Depending on the sweetness and strength, a subtle to distinctly identifiable
        honey and fruit character (dry and/or hydromel versions will tend to have
        lower aromatics than sweet and/or sack versions). The fruit character should
        display distinctive aromatics associated with the particular fruit(s,'); however,
        note that some fruit (e.g., raspberries, cherries) have stronger aromas and
        are more distinctive than others (e.g., blueberries, strawberries) allow for
        a range of fruit character and intensity from subtle to aggressive. The fruit
        character should be pleasant and supportive, not artificial and inappropriately
        overpowering (considering the character of the fruit). In a blended fruit
        melomel, not all fruit may be individually identifiable or of equal intensity.
        The honey aroma should be noticeable, and can have a light to significant
        sweetness that may express the aroma of flower nectar. If a variety of honey
        is declared, the aroma might have a subtle to very noticeable varietal character
        reflective of the honey (different varieties have different intensities and
        characters). The bouquet should show a pleasant fermentation character, with
        clean and fresh aromatics being preferred. Stronger and/or sweeter versions
        will have higher alcohol and sweetness in the nose. Some tartness may be present
        if naturally occurring in the particular fruit(s), but should not be inappropriately
        intense. Standard description applies for remainder of characteristics.Standard
        description applies, except with regard to color. Color may take on a very
        wide range of colors, depending on the variety of fruit and/or honey used.
        For lighter-colored melomels with fruits that exhibit distinctive colors,
        the color should be noticeable. Note that the color of fruit in mead is often
        lighter than the flesh of the fruit itself and may take on slightly different
        shades. Meads made with lighter color fruits can also take on color from varietal
        honeys. In meads that produce a head, the head can take on some of the fruit
        color as well. The fruit and honey flavor intensity may vary from subtle to
        high; the residual sweetness may vary from none to high; and the finish may
        range from dry to sweet, depending on what sweetness level has been declared
        (dry to sweet) and strength level has been declared (hydromel to sack). Natural
        acidity and tannin in some fruit and fruit skin may give some tartness and
        astringency to balance the sweetness, honey flavor and alcohol. A melomel
        may have a subtle to strong honey character, and may feature noticeable to
        prominent varietal character if a varietal honey is declared (different varieties
        have different intensities). The distinctive flavor character associated with
        the particular fruit(s) should be noticeable, and may range in intensity from
        subtle to aggressive. The balance of fruit with the underlying mead is vital,
        and the fruit character should not be artificial and/or inappropriately overpowering.
        In a blended fruit melomel, not all fruit may be individually identifiable
        or of equal intensity. Standard description applies for remainder of characteristics.Standard
        description applies. Most will be wine-like. Some natural acidity and/or astringency
        are sometimes present (from certain fruit and/or fruit skin) and helps balance
        the overall impression. Fruit tannin can add body as well as some astringency.
        High levels of astringency are undesirable. The acidity and astringency levels
        should be somewhat reflective of the fruit used.In well-made examples of the
        style, the fruit is both distinctive and well-incorporated into the honey-sweet-acid-tannin-alcohol
        balance of the mead. Different types of fruit can result in widely different
        characteristics; allow for a variation in the final product.

    ingredients: Different materials used to smoke malt result in unique flavor and
        aroma characteristics. Beechwood-, peat- or other hardwood (oak, maple, mesquite,
        alder, pecan, apple, cherry, other fruitwoods) smoked malts may be used. The
        various woods may remind one of certain smoked products due to their food
        association (e.g., hickory with ribs, maple with bacon or sausage, and alder
        with salmon). Evergreen wood should never be used since it adds a medicinal,
        piney flavor to the malt.  Excessive peat-smoked malt is generally undesirable
        due to its sharp, piercing phenolics and dirt-like earthiness. The remaining
        ingredients vary with the base style. If smoked malts are combined with other
        unusual ingredients (fruits, vegetables, spices, honey, etc.) in noticeable
        quantities, the resulting beer should be entered in the specialty/experimental
        category.

    notes: Any style of beer can be smoked; the goal is to reach a pleasant balance
        between the smoke character and the base beer style. IF THIS BEER IS BASED
        ON A CLASSIC STYLE (E.G., ROBUST PORTER) THEN THE SPECIFIC STYLE MUST BE SPECIFIED.
        CLASSIC STYLES DO NOT HAVE TO BE CITED (E.G., "PORTER" OR "BROWN ALE" IS ACCEPTABLE).
        THE TYPE OF WOOD OR OTHER SOURCE OF SMOKE MUST BE SPECIFIED IF A "VARIETAL"
        CHARACTER IS NOTICEABLE. Entries that have a classic style cited will be judged
        on how well that style is represented, and how well it is balanced with the
        smoke character. Entries with a specific type or types of smoke cited will
        be judged on how well that type of smoke is recognizable and marries with
        the base style. Specific classic styles or smoke types do not have to be specified.
        For example, "smoked porter" is as acceptable as "peat-smoked strong Scotch
        ale" or "cherry-wood smoked IPA." Judges should evaluate the beers mostly
        on the overall balance, and how well the smoke character enhances the base
        beer.

    profile: ' A Pyment is a melomel made with grapes (generally from juice). Depending
        on the sweetness and strength, a subtle to distinctly identifiable honey and
        grape/wine character (dry and/or hydromel versions will tend to have lower
        aromatics than sweet and/or sack versions). The grape/wine character should
        be clean and distinctive; it can express a range of grape-based character
        ranging from a subtle fruitiness to a single varietal grape character (if
        declared) to a complex blend of grape or wine aromatics. Some complex, spicy,
        grassy or earthy notes may be present (as in wine). The honey aroma should
        be noticeable, and can have a light to significant sweetness that may express
        the aroma of flower nectar. If a variety of honey is declared, the aroma might
        have a subtle to very noticeable varietal character reflective of the honey
        (different varieties have different intensities and characters). The bouquet
        should show a pleasant fermentation character, with clean and fresh aromatics
        being preferred. Stronger and/or sweeter versions will have higher alcohol
        and sweetness in the nose. Slight spicy phenolics from certain red grape varieties
        are acceptable, as is a light diacetyl character from malolactic fermentation
        in certain white grape varieties (both are optional). Standard description
        applies for remainder of characteristics.Standard description applies, except
        with regard to color. Color may range from pale straw to deep purple-red,
        depending on the variety of grapes and honey used. The color should be characteristic
        of the variety or type of grape used, although white grape varieties may also
        take on color derived from the honey variety. The grape/wine and honey flavor
        intensity may vary from subtle to high; the residual sweetness may vary from
        none to high; and the finish may range from dry to sweet, depending on what
        sweetness level has been declared (dry to sweet) and strength level has been
        declared (hydromel to sack). Natural acidity and tannin in grapes may give
        some tartness and astringency to balance the sweetness, honey flavor and alcohol.
        A pyment may have a subtle to strong honey character, and may feature noticeable
        to prominent varietal character if a varietal honey is declared (different
        varieties have different intensities). Depending on the grape variety, some
        fruity, spicy, grassy, buttery, earthy, minerally, and/or floral flavors may
        be present. Standard description applies for remainder of characteristics.Standard
        description applies. Wine-like. Some natural acidity is usually present (from
        grapes) and helps balance the overall impression. Grape tannin and/or grape
        skins can add body as well as some astringency, although this character should
        not be excessive. Longer aging can smooth out tannin-based astringency.In
        well-made examples of the style, the grape is both distinctively vinous and
        well-incorporated into the honey-sweet-acid-tannin-alcohol balance of the
        mead. White and red versions can be quite different, and the overall impression
        should be characteristic of the type of grapes used and suggestive of a similar
        variety wine. '

    ingredients: May contain several malts, prominently dark roasted malts and grains,
        which often include black patent malt (chocolate malt and/or roasted barley
        may also be used in some versions). Hops are used for bittering, flavor and/or
        aroma, and are frequently UK or US varieties. Water with moderate to high
        carbonate hardness is typical. Ale yeast can either be clean US versions or
        characterful English varieties.
    name: Robust Porter
    notes: Although a rather broad style open to brewer interpretation, it may be
        distinguished from Stout as lacking a strong roasted barley character. It
        differs from a brown porter in that a black patent or roasted grain character
        is usually present, and it can be stronger in alcohol. Roast intensity and
        malt flavors can also vary significantly. May or may not have a strong hop
        character, and may or may not have significant fermentation by-products; thus
        may seem to have an "American" or "English" character.

        chocolate, coffee, rich, and/or sweet). Hop aroma low to high (US or UK varieties).
        Some American versions may be dry-hopped. Fruity esters are moderate to none.
        Diacetyl low to none.Medium brown to very dark brown, often with ruby- or
        garnet-like highlights. Can approach black in color. Clarity may be difficult
        to discern in such a dark beer, but when not opaque will be clear (particularly
        when held up to the light). Full, tan-colored head with moderately good head
        retention.Moderately strong malt flavor usually features a lightly burnt,
        black malt character (and sometimes chocolate and/or coffee flavors) with
        a bit of roasty dryness in the finish. Overall flavor may finish from dry
        to medium-sweet, depending on grist composition, hop bittering level, and
        attenuation. May have a sharp character from dark roasted grains, although
        should not be overly acrid, burnt or harsh. Medium to high bitterness, which
        can be accentuated by the roasted malt. Hop flavor can vary from low to moderately
        high (US or UK varieties, typically), and balances the roasted malt flavors.
        Diacetyl low to none. Fruity esters moderate to none.Medium to medium-full
        body. Moderately low to moderately high carbonation. Stronger versions may
        have a slight alcohol warmth. May have a slight astringency from roasted grains,

        with a complex and flavorful roasty character. Stronger, hoppier and/or roastier

    ingredients: Malted rye typically constitutes 50% or greater of the grist (some
        versions have 60-65% rye). Remainder of grist can include pale malt, Munich
        malt, wheat malt, crystal malt and/or small amounts of debittered dark malts
        for color adjustment. Weizen yeast provides distinctive banana esters and
        clove phenols. Light usage of noble hops in bitterness, flavor and aroma.
        Lower fermentation temperatures accentuate the clove character by suppressing
        ester formation. Decoction mash commonly used (as with weizenbiers).
    name: Roggenbier (German Rye Beer)
    notes: American-style rye beers should be entered in the American Rye category
        (6D). Other traditional beer styles with enough rye added to give a noticeable
        rye character should be entered in the Specialty Beer category (23). Rye is
        a huskless grain and is difficult to mash, often resulting in a gummy mash
        texture that is prone to sticking. Rye has been characterized as having the
        most assertive flavor of all cereal grains. It is inappropriate to add caraway
        seeds to a roggenbier (as some American brewers do,'); the rye character is
        traditionally from the rye grain only.

        thick and rocky). Cloudy, hazy appearance.Grainy, moderately-low to moderately-strong
        spicy rye flavor, often having a hearty flavor reminiscent of rye or pumpernickel
        bread. Medium to medium-low bitterness allows an initial malt sweetness (sometimes
        with a bit of caramel) to be tasted before yeast and rye character takes over.
        Low to moderate weizen yeast character (banana, clove, and sometimes citrus),
        although the balance can vary. Medium-dry, grainy finish with a tangy, lightly
        bitter (from rye) aftertaste. Low to moderate noble hop flavor acceptable,
        and can persist into aftertaste. No diacetyl.Medium to medium-full body. High
        carbonation. Light tartness optional.A dunkelweizen made with rye rather than
        wheat, but with a greater body and light finishing hops. A specialty beer
        originally brewed in Regensburg, Bavaria as a more distinctive variant of
        a dunkelweizen using malted rye instead of malted wheat.

        the American versions have more bitterness, roasted character, and finishing
        hops, while the English varieties reflect a more complex specialty malt character
        and a more forward ester profile). The wide range of allowable characteristics

    profile: Rich and complex, with variable amounts of roasted grains, maltiness,
        fruity esters, hops, and alcohol. The roasted malt character can take on coffee,
        dark chocolate, or slightly burnt tones and can be light to moderately strong.
        The malt aroma can be subtle to rich and barleywine-like, depending on the
        gravity and grain bill. May optionally show a slight specialty malt character
        (e.g., caramel), but this should only add complexity and not dominate. Fruity
        esters may be low to moderately strong, and may take on a complex, dark fruit
        (e.g., plums, prunes, raisins) character. Hop aroma can be very low to quite
        aggressive, and may contain any hop variety. An alcohol character may be present,
        but shouldn't be sharp, hot or solventy. Aged versions may have a slight vinous
        or port-like quality, but shouldn't be sour. No diacetyl. The balance can
        vary with any of the aroma elements taking center stage. Not all possible
        aromas described need be present; many interpretations are possible. Aging
        affects the intensity, balance and smoothness of aromatics.Color may range
        from very dark reddish-brown to jet black. Opaque. Deep tan to dark brown
        head. Generally has a well-formed head, although head retention may be low
        to moderate. High alcohol and viscosity may be visible in "legs" when beer
        is swirled in a glass.Rich, deep, complex and frequently quite intense, with
        variable amounts of roasted malt/grains, maltiness, fruity esters, hop bitterness
        and flavor, and alcohol. Medium to aggressively high bitterness. Medium-low
        to high hop flavor (any variety). Moderate to aggressively high roasted malt/grain
        flavors can suggest bittersweet or unsweetened chocolate, cocoa, and/or strong
        coffee. A slightly burnt grain, burnt currant or tarry character may be evident.
        Fruity esters may be low to intense, and can take on a dark fruit character
        (raisins, plums, or prunes). Malt backbone can be balanced and supportive
        to rich and barleywine-like, and may optionally show some supporting caramel,
        bready or toasty flavors. Alcohol strength should be evident, but not hot,
        sharp, or solventy. No diacetyl. The palate and finish can vary from relatively
        dry to moderately sweet, usually with some lingering roastiness, hop bitterness
        and warming character. The balance and intensity of flavors can be affected
        by aging, with some flavors becoming more subdued over time and some aged,
        vinous or port-like qualities developing.Full to very full-bodied and chewy,
        with a velvety, luscious texture (although the body may decline with long
        conditioning). Gentle smooth warmth from alcohol should be present and noticeable.
        Should not be syrupy and under-attenuated. Carbonation may be low to moderate,
        depending on age and conditioning.An intensely flavored, big, dark ale. Roasty,
        fruity, and bittersweet, with a noticeable alcohol presence. Dark fruit flavors
        meld with roasty, burnt, or almost tar-like sensations. Like a black barleywine
        with every dimension of flavor coming into play. Brewed to high gravity and
        hopping level in England for export to the Baltic States and Russia. Said
        to be popular with the Russian Imperial Court. Today is even more popular
        with American craft brewers, who have extended the style with unique American
        characteristics.

        add complexity and thin the body. Hop bitterness and flavor may be more noticeable
        than in many other Belgian styles. A saison is sometimes dry-hopped. Noble
        hops, Styrian or East Kent Goldings are commonly used. A wide variety of herbs
        and spices are often used to add complexity and uniqueness in the stronger
        versions, but should always meld well with the yeast and hop character. Varying
        degrees of acidity and/or sourness can be created by the use of gypsum, acidulated
        malt, a sour mash or Lactobacillus. Hard water, common to most of Wallonia,
        can accentuate the bitterness and dry finish.
    name: Saison
    notes: Varying strength examples exist (table beers of about 5% strength, typical
        export beers of about 6.5%, and stronger versions of 8%+). Strong versions
        (6.5%-9.5%) and darker versions (copper to dark brown/black) should be entered
        as Belgian Specialty Ales (16E). Sweetness decreases and spice, hop and sour
        character increases with strength. Herb and spice additions often reflect
        the indigenous varieties available at the brewery. High carbonation and extreme
        attenuation (85-95%) helps bring out the many flavors and to increase the
        perception of a dry finish. All of these beers share somewhat higher levels
        of acidity than other Belgian styles while the optional sour flavor is often
        a variable house character of a particular brewery.

    profile: High fruitiness with low to moderate hop aroma and moderate to no herb,
        spice and alcohol aroma. Fruity esters dominate the aroma and are often reminiscent
        of citrus fruits such as oranges or lemons. A low to medium-high spicy or
        floral hop aroma is usually present. A moderate spice aroma (from actual spice
        additions and/or yeast-derived phenols) complements the other aromatics. When
        phenolics are present they tend to be peppery rather than clove-like. A low
        to moderate sourness or acidity may be present, but should not overwhelm other
        characteristics. Spice, hop and sour aromatics typically increase with the
        strength of the beer. Alcohols are soft, spicy and low in intensity, and should
        not be hot or solventy. The malt character is light. No diacetyl.Often a distinctive
        pale orange but may be golden or amber in color. There is no correlation between
        strength and color. Long-lasting, dense, rocky white to ivory head resulting
        in characteristic "Belgian lace" on the glass as it fades. Clarity is poor
        to good though haze is not unexpected in this type of unfiltered farmhouse
        beer. Effervescent.Combination of fruity and spicy flavors supported by a
        soft malt character, a low to moderate alcohol presence and tart sourness.
        Extremely high attenuation gives a characteristic dry finish. The fruitiness
        is frequently citrusy (orange- or lemon-like). The addition of one of more
        spices serve to add complexity, but shouldn't dominate in the balance. Low
        peppery yeast-derived phenols may be present instead of or in addition to
        spice additions; phenols tend to be lower than in many other Belgian beers,
        and complement the bitterness. Hop flavor is low to moderate, and is generally
        spicy or earthy in character. Hop bitterness may be moderate to high, but
        should not overwhelm fruity esters, spices, and malt. Malt character is light
        but provides a sufficient background for the other flavors. A low to moderate
        tart sourness may be present, but should not overwhelm other flavors. Spices,
        hop bitterness and flavor, and sourness commonly increase with the strength
        of the beer while sweetness decreases. No hot alcohol or solventy character.
        High carbonation, moderately sulfate water, and high attenuation give a very
        dry finish with a long, bitter, sometimes spicy aftertaste. The perceived
        bitterness is often higher than the IBU level would suggest. No diacetyl.Light
        to medium body. Alcohol level can be medium to medium-high, though the warming
        character is low to medium. No hot alcohol or solventy character. Very high
        carbonation with an effervescent quality. There is enough prickly acidity
        on the tongue to balance the very dry finish. A low to moderate tart character
        may be present but should be refreshing and not to the point of puckering.A
        refreshing, medium to strong fruity/spicy ale with a distinctive yellow-orange
        color, highly carbonated, well hopped, and dry with a quenching acidity. A
        seasonal summer style produced in Wallonia, the French-speaking part of Belgium.
        Originally brewed at the end of the cool season to last through the warmer
        months before refrigeration was common. It had to be sturdy enough to last
        for months but not too strong to be quenching and refreshing in the summer.
        It is now brewed year-round in tiny, artisanal breweries whose buildings reflect
        their origins as farmhouses.

    ingredients: German Munich malt and Pilsner malts for the base, supplemented by
        a small amount of roasted malts (such as Carafa) for the dark color and subtle
        roast flavors. Noble-type German hop varieties and clean German lager yeasts
        are preferred.
    name: Schwarzbier (Black Beer)
    notes: In comparison with a Munich Dunkel, usually darker in color, drier on the
        palate and with a noticeable (but not high) roasted malt edge to balance the
        malt base. While sometimes called a "black Pils," the beer is rarely that
        dark; don't expect strongly roasted, porter-like flavors.

    profile: Low to moderate malt, with low aromatic sweetness and/or hints of roast
        malt often apparent. The malt can be clean and neutral or rich and Munich-like,
        and may have a hint of caramel. The roast can be coffee-like but should never
        be burnt. A low noble hop aroma is optional. Clean lager yeast character (light
        sulfur possible) with no fruity esters or diacetyl.Medium to very dark brown
        in color, often with deep ruby to garnet highlights, yet almost never truly
        black. Very clear. Large, persistent, tan-colored head.Light to moderate malt
        flavor, which can have a clean, neutral character to a rich, sweet, Munich-like
        intensity. Light to moderate roasted malt flavors can give a bitter-chocolate
        palate that lasts into the finish, but which are never burnt. Medium-low to
        medium bitterness, which can last into the finish. Light to moderate noble
        hop flavor. Clean lager character with no fruity esters or diacetyl. Aftertaste
        tends to dry out slowly and linger, featuring hop bitterness with a complementary
        but subtle roastiness in the background. Some residual sweetness is acceptable
        but not required.Medium-light to medium body. Moderate to moderately high
        carbonation. Smooth. No harshness or astringency, despite the use of dark,
        roasted malts.A dark German lager that balances roasted yet smooth malt flavors
        with moderate hop bitterness. A regional specialty from southern Thuringen
        and northern Franconia in Germany, and probably a variant of the Munich Dunkel
        style.

        Low to moderately low carbonation. Quite creamy and smooth in texture, particularly
        for its gravity.A luscious, malt-oriented brown ale, with a caramel, dark
        fruit complexity of malt flavor. May seem somewhat like a smaller version
        of a sweet stout or a sweet version of a dark mild. English brown ales are
        generally split into sub-styles along geographic lines. Southern English (or
        "London-style") brown ales are darker, sweeter, and lower gravity than their
        Northern cousins. Developed as a bottled product in the early 20th century
        out of a reaction against vinous vatted porter and often unpalatable mild.
        Well suited to London's water supply.

    ingredients: Pale ale, amber, and/or crystal malts, may use a touch of black malt
        for color adjustment. May use sugar adjuncts, corn or wheat. English hops
        most typical, although American and European varieties are becoming more common
        (particularly in the paler examples). Characterful English yeast. Often medium
        sulfate water is used.
    name: Special/Best/Premium Bitter
    notes: More evident malt flavor than in an ordinary bitter, this is a stronger,
        session-strength ale. Some modern variants are brewed exclusively with pale
        malt and are known as golden or summer bitters. Most bottled or kegged versions
        of UK-produced bitters are higher-alcohol versions of their cask (draught)
        products produced specifically for export. The IBU levels are often not adjusted,
        so the versions available in the US often do not directly correspond to their
        style subcategories in Britain. This style guideline reflects the "real ale"
        version of the style, not the export formulations of commercial products.

    profile: The best examples have some malt aroma, often (but not always) with a
        caramel quality. Mild to moderate fruitiness. Hop aroma can range from moderate
        to none (UK varieties typically, although US varieties may be used). Generally
        no diacetyl, although very low levels are allowed.Medium gold to medium copper.
        Good to brilliant clarity. Low to moderate white to off-white head. May have
        very little head due to low carbonation.Medium to high bitterness. Most have
        moderately low to moderately high fruity esters. Moderate to low hop flavor
        (earthy, resiny, and/or floral UK varieties typically, although US varieties
        may be used). Low to medium maltiness with a dry finish. Caramel flavors are
        common but not required. Balance is often decidedly bitter, although the bitterness
        should not completely overpower the malt flavor, esters and hop flavor. Generally
        no diacetyl, although very low levels are allowed.Medium-light to medium body.
        Carbonation low, although bottled and canned commercial examples can have
        moderate carbonation.A flavorful, yet refreshing, session beer. Some examples
        can be more malt balanced, but this should not override the overall bitter
        impression. Drinkability is a critical component of the style; emphasis is
        still on the bittering hop addition as opposed to the aggressive middle and
        late hopping seen in American ales. Originally a draught ale served very fresh
        under no pressure (gravity or hand pump only) at cellar temperatures (i.e.,
        "real ale"). Bitter was created as a draught alternative (i.e., running beer)
        to country-brewed pale ale around the start of the 20th century and became
        widespread once brewers understood how to "Burtonize" their water to successfully
        brew pale beers and to use crystal malts to add a fullness and roundness of
        palate.

    name: Specialty Beer
    notes: Overall harmony and drinkability are the keys to presenting a well-made
        specialty beer. The distinctive nature of the stated specialty ingredients/methods
        should complement the original style (if declared) and not totally overwhelm
        it. The brewer should recognize that some combinations of base beer styles
        and ingredients or techniques work well together while others do not make
        palatable combinations. THE BREWER MUST SPECIFY THE "EXPERIMENTAL NATURE"
        OF THE BEER (E.G., TYPE OF SPECIAL INGREDIENTS USED, PROCESS UTILIZED OR HISTORICAL
        STYLE BEING BREWED), OR WHY THE BEER DOESN'T FIT AN ESTABLISHED STYLE. For
        historical styles or unusual ingredients/techniques that may not be known
        to all beer judges, the brewer should provide descriptions of the styles,
        ingredients and/or techniques as an aid to the judges.THE BREWER MAY SPECIFY
        AN UNDERLYING BEER STYLE. The base style may be a classic style (i.e., a named
        subcategory from these Style Guidelines) or a broader characterization (e.g.,
        "Porter" or "Brown Ale"). If a base style is declared, the style should be
        recognizable. The beer should be judged by how well the special ingredient
        or process complements, enhances, and harmonizes with the underlying style.
    og_max: 1.2
    og_min: 1.0
    profile: The character of the stated specialty ingredient or nature should be
        evident in the aroma, but harmonious with the other components (yet not totally
        overpowering them). Overall the aroma should be a pleasant combination of
        malt, hops and the featured specialty ingredient or nature as appropriate
        to the specific type of beer being presented. The individual character of
        special ingredients and processes may not always be identifiable when used
        in combination. If a classic style base beer is specified then the characteristics
        of that classic style should be noticeable. Note, however, that classic styles
        will have a different impression when brewed with unusual ingredients, additives
        or processes. The typical aroma components of classic beer styles (particularly
        hops) may be intentionally subdued to allow the special ingredients or nature
        to be more apparent.Appearance should be appropriate to the base beer being
        presented and will vary depending on the base beer (if declared). Note that
        unusual ingredients or processes may affect the appearance so that the result
        is quite different from the declared base style. Some ingredients may add
        color (including to the head), and may affect head formation and retention.As
        with aroma, the distinctive flavor character associated with the stated specialty
        nature should be noticeable, and may range in intensity from subtle to aggressive.
        The marriage of specialty ingredients or nature with the underlying beer should
        be harmonious, and the specialty character should not seem artificial and/or
        totally overpowering. Hop bitterness, flavor, malt flavors, alcohol content,
        and fermentation by-products, such as esters or diacetyl, should be appropriate
        to the base beer (if declared) and be well-integrated with the distinctive
        specialty flavors present. Some ingredients may add tartness, sweetness, or
        other flavor by-products. Remember that fruit and sugar adjuncts generally
        add flavor and not excessive sweetness to beer. The sugary adjuncts, as well
        as sugar found in fruit, are usually fully fermented and contribute to a lighter
        flavor profile and a drier finish than might be expected for the declared
        base style. The individual character of special ingredients and processes
        may not always be identifiable when used in combination. If a classic style
        base beer is specified then the characteristics of that classic style should
        be noticeable. Note, however, that classic styles will have a different impression
        when brewed with unusual ingredients, additives or processes. Note that these
        components (especially hops) may be intentionally subdued to allow the specialty
        character to come through in the final presentation.Mouthfeel may vary depending
        on the base beer selected and as appropriate to that base beer (if declared).
        Body and carbonation levels should be appropriate to the base beer style being
        presented. Unusual ingredients or processes may affect the mouthfeel so that
        the result is quite different from the declared base style.A harmonious marriage
        of ingredients, processes and beer. The key attributes of the underlying style
        (if declared) will be atypical due to the addition of special ingredients
        or techniques; do not expect the base beer to taste the same as the unadulterated
        version. Judge the beer based on the pleasantness and harmony of the resulting
        combination. The overall uniqueness of the process, ingredients used, and
        creativity should be considered. The overall rating of the beer depends heavily
        on the inherently subjective assessment of distinctiveness and drinkability.

    name: Spice, Herb, or Vegetable Beer
    notes: Overall balance is the key to presenting a well-made spice, herb or vegetable
        (SHV) beer. The SHV(s) should complement the original style and not overwhelm
        it. The brewer should recognize that some combinations of base beer styles
        and SHV(s) work well together while others do not make for harmonious combinations.
        THE ENTRANT MUST SPECIFY THE UNDERLYING BEER STYLE AS WELL AS THE TYPE OF
        SPICES, HERBS, OR VEGETABLES USED. IF THIS BEER IS BASED ON A CLASSIC STYLE
        (E.G., BLONDE ALE) THEN THE SPECIFIC STYLE MUST BE SPECIFIED. CLASSIC STYLES
        DO NOT HAVE TO BE CITED (E.G., "PORTER" OR "WHEAT ALE" IS ACCEPTABLE). THE
        TYPE OF SPICES, HERBS, OR VEGETABLES MUST ALWAYS BE SPECIFIED. If the base
        beer is a classic style, the original style should come through in aroma and
        flavor. The individual character of SHV(s) may not always be identifiable
        when used in combination. This category may also be used for chile pepper,
        coffee-, chocolate-, or nut-based beers (including combinations of these items).
        Note that many spice-based Belgian specialties may be entered in Category
        16E. Beers that only have additional fermentables (honey, maple syrup, molasses,
        sugars, treacle, etc.) should be entered in the Specialty Beer category.
    og_max: 1.2
    og_min: 1.0
    profile: 'The character of the particular spices, herbs and/or vegetables (SHV)
        should be noticeable in the aroma; however, note that some SHV (e.g., ginger,
        cinnamon) have stronger aromas and are more distinctive than others (e.g.,
        some vegetables) allow for a range of SHV character and intensity from subtle
        to aggressive. The individual character of the SHV(s) may not always be identifiable
        when used in combination. The SHV character should be pleasant and supportive,
        not artificial and overpowering. As with all specialty beers, a proper SHV
        beer should be a harmonious balance of the featured SHV(s) with the underlying
        beer style. Aroma hops, yeast by-products and malt components of the underlying
        beer may not be as noticeable when SHV are present. These components (especially
        hops) may also be intentionally subdued to allow the SHV character to come
        through in the final presentation. If the base beer is an ale then a non-specific
        fruitiness and/or other fermentation by-products such as diacetyl may be present
        as appropriate for warmer fermentations. If the base beer is a lager, then
        overall less fermentation byproducts would be appropriate. Some malt aroma
        is preferable, especially in dark styles. Hop aroma may be absent or balanced
        with SHV, depending on the style. The SHV(s) should add an extra complexity
        to the beer, but not be so prominent as to unbalance the resulting presentation.Appearance
        should be appropriate to the base beer being presented and will vary depending
        on the base beer. For lighter-colored beers with spices, herbs or vegetables
        that exhibit distinctive colors, the colors may be noticeable in the beer
        and possibly the head. May have some haze or be clear. Head formation may
        be adversely affected by some ingredients, such as chocolate.As with aroma,
        the distinctive flavor character associated with the particular SHV(s) should
        be noticeable, and may range in intensity from subtle to aggressive. The individual
        character of the SHV(s) may not always be identifiable when used in combination.
        The balance of SHV with the underlying beer is vital, and the SHV character
        should not be so artificial and/or overpowering as to overwhelm the beer.
        Hop bitterness, flavor, malt flavors, alcohol content, and fermentation by-products,
        such as esters or diacetyl, should be appropriate to the base beer and be
        harmonious and balanced with the distinctive SHV flavors present. Note that
        these components (especially hops) may be intentionally subdued to allow the
        SHV character to come through in the final presentation. Some SHV(s) are inherently
        bitter and may result in a beer more bitter than the declared base style.Mouthfeel
        may vary depending on the base beer selected and as appropriate to that base
        beer. Body and carbonation levels should be appropriate to the base beer style
        being presented. Some SHV(s) may add additional body and/or slickness, although
        fermentable additions may thin out the beer. Some SHV(s) may add a bit of
        astringency, although a "raw" spice character is undesirable.A harmonious
        marriage of spices, herbs and/or vegetables and beer. The key attributes of
        the underlying style will be different with the addition of spices, herbs
        and/or vegetables; do not expect the base beer to taste the same as the unadulterated
        version. Judge the beer based on the pleasantness and balance of the resulting

    ingredients: Unmalted wheat (30-40%), Pilsner malt and aged (surannes) hops (3
        years) are used. The aged hops are used more for preservative effects than
        bitterness, and makes actual bitterness levels difficult to estimate. Traditionally
        these beers are spontaneously fermented with naturally-occurring yeast and
        bacteria in predominately oaken barrels. Home-brewed and craft-brewed versions
        are more typically made with pure cultures of yeast commonly including Saccharomyces,
        Brettanomyces, Pediococcus and Lactobacillus in an attempt to recreate the
        effects of the dominant microbiota of Brussels and the surrounding countryside
        of the Senne River valley. Cultures taken from bottles are sometimes used
        but there is no simple way of knowing what organisms are still viable.
    name: Straight (Unblended) Lambic
    notes: Straight lambics are single-batch, unblended beers. Since they are unblended,
        the straight lambic is often a true product of the "house character" of a
        brewery and will be more variable than a gueuze. They are generally served
        young (6 months) and on tap as cheap, easy-drinking beers without any filling
        carbonation. Younger versions tend to be one-dimensionally sour since a complex
        Brett character often takes upwards of a year to develop. An enteric character
        is often indicative of a lambic that is too young. A noticeable vinegary or
        cidery character is considered a fault by Belgian brewers. Since the wild
        yeast and bacteria will ferment ALL sugars, they are bottled only when they
        have completely fermented. Lambic is served uncarbonated, while gueuze is
        served effervescent. IBUs are approximate since aged hops are used; Belgians
        use hops for anti-bacterial properties more than bittering in lambics.

    profile: A decidedly sour/acidic aroma is often dominant in young examples, but
        may be more subdued with age as it blends with aromas described as barnyard,
        earthy, goaty, hay, horsey, and horse blanket. A mild oak and/or citrus aroma
        is considered favorable. An enteric, smoky, cigar-like, or cheesy aroma is
        unfavorable. Older versions are commonly fruity with aromas of apples or even
        honey. No hop aroma. No diacetyl.Pale yellow to deep golden in color. Age
        tends to darken the beer. Clarity is hazy to good. Younger versions are often
        cloudy, while older ones are generally clear. Head retention is generally
        poor. Head color is white.Young examples are often noticeably sour and/or
        lactic, but aging can bring this character more in balance with the malt,
        wheat and barnyard characteristics. Fruity flavors are simpler in young lambics
        and more complex in the older examples, where they are reminiscent of apples
        or other light fruits, rhubarb, or honey. Some oak or citrus flavor (often
        grapefruit) is occasionally noticeable. An enteric, smoky or cigar-like character
        is undesirable. Hop bitterness is low to none. No hop flavor. No diacetyl.Light
        to medium-light body. In spite of the low finishing gravity, the many mouth-filling
        flavors prevent the beer from tasting like water. As a rule of thumb lambic

        by a variety of Belgian microbiota. Spontaneously fermented sour ales from

        tradition several centuries old. Their numbers are constantly dwindling.

    ingredients: Well-modified pale malt, with up to 3% roasted barley. May use some
        crystal malt for color adjustment; sweetness usually comes not from crystal
        malts rather from low hopping, high mash temperatures, and kettle caramelization.
        A small proportion of smoked malt may add depth, though a peaty character
        (sometimes perceived as earthy or smoky) may also originate from the yeast
        and native water. Hop presence is minimal, although English varieties are
        most authentic. Fairly soft water is typical.
    name: Strong Scotch Ale
    notes: Also known as a "wee heavy." Fermented at cooler temperatures than most
        ales, and with lower hopping rates, resulting in clean, intense malt flavors.
        Well suited to the region of origin, with abundant malt and cool fermentation
        and aging temperature. Hops, which are not native to Scotland and formerly
        expensive to import, were kept to a minimum.

    ingredients: Standard description applies. Traditional Meads feature the character
        of a blended honey or a blend of honeys. Varietal meads feature the distinctive
        character of certain honeys. "Show meads" feature no additives, but this distinction
        is usually not obvious to judges.

        characteristics are undesirable. Standard description applies for remainder
        of characteristics.Standard description applies, although the body is generally
        medium-full to full. Note that stronger meads will have a fuller body. Many
        seem like a dessert wine. Sensations of body should not be accompanied by
        cloying, raw residual sweetness.Similar in balance, body, finish and flavor
        intensity to a well-made dessert wine (such as Sauternes), with a pleasant
        mixture of honey character, residual sweetness, soft fruity esters, and clean
        alcohol. Complexity, harmony, and balance of sensory elements are most desirable,
        with no inconsistencies in color, aroma, flavor or aftertaste. The proper
        balance of sweetness, acidity, alcohol and honey character is the essential
        final measure of any mead.

    ingredients: The sweetness in most Sweet Stouts comes from a lower bitterness
        level than dry stouts and a high percentage of unfermentable dextrins.  Lactose,
        an unfermentable sugar, is frequently added to provide additional residual
        sweetness. Base of pale malt, and may use roasted barley, black malt, chocolate
        malt, crystal malt, and adjuncts such as maize or treacle. High carbonate
        water is common.
    name: Sweet Stout
    notes: Gravities are low in England, higher in exported and US products. Variations
        exist, with the level of residual sweetness, the intensity of the roast character,

        which was a brewing center and popular exporter in the days of the Hanseatic
        League (14th to 17th century).  Recreated in Munich starting in the 17th century.
        The name "bock" is based on a corruption of the name "Einbeck" in the Bavarian
        dialect, and was thus only used after the beer came to Munich. "Bock" also
        means "billy-goat" in German, and is often used in logos and advertisements.

    ingredients: By German law, at least 50% of the grist must be malted wheat, although
        some versions use up to 70%; the remainder is Pilsner malt. A traditional
        decoction mash gives the appropriate body without cloying sweetness. Weizen
        ale yeasts produce the typical spicy and fruity character, although extreme
        fermentation temperatures can affect the balance and produce off-flavors.
        A small amount of noble hops are used only for bitterness.
    name: Weizen/Weissbier
    notes: These are refreshing, fast-maturing beers that are lightly hopped and show
        a unique banana-and-clove yeast character. These beers often don't age well
        and are best enjoyed while young and fresh. The version "mit hefe" is served
        with yeast sediment stirred in; the krystal version is filtered for excellent
        clarity. Bottles with yeast are traditionally swirled or gently rolled prior
        to serving. The character of a krystal weizen is generally fruitier and less
        phenolic than that of the hefe-weizen.
    og_max: 1.052

    profile: Moderate to strong phenols (usually clove) and fruity esters (usually
        banana). The balance and intensity of the phenol and ester components can
        vary but the best examples are reasonably balanced and fairly prominent. Noble
        hop character ranges from low to none. A light to moderate wheat aroma (which
        might be perceived as bready or grainy) may be present but other malt characteristics
        should not. No diacetyl or DMS. Optional, but acceptable, aromatics can include
        a light, citrusy tartness, a light to moderate vanilla character, and/or a
        low bubblegum aroma. None of these optional characteristics should be high
        or dominant, but often can add to the complexity and balance.Pale straw to
        very dark gold in color. A very thick, moussy, long-lasting white head is
        characteristic. The high protein content of wheat impairs clarity in an unfiltered
        beer, although the level of haze is somewhat variable. A beer "mit hefe" is
        also cloudy from suspended yeast sediment (which should be roused before drinking).
        The filtered Krystal version has no yeast and is brilliantly clear.Low to
        moderately strong banana and clove flavor. The balance and intensity of the
        phenol and ester components can vary but the best examples are reasonably
        balanced and fairly prominent. Optionally, a very light to moderate vanilla
        character and/or low bubblegum notes can accentuate the banana flavor, sweetness
        and roundness; neither should be dominant if present. The soft, somewhat bready
        or grainy flavor of wheat is complementary, as is a slightly sweet Pils malt
        character. Hop flavor is very low to none, and hop bitterness is very low
        to moderately low. A tart, citrusy character from yeast and high carbonation
        is often present. Well rounded, flavorful palate with a relatively dry finish.
        No diacetyl or DMS.Medium-light to medium body; never heavy. Suspended yeast
        may increase the perception of body. The texture of wheat imparts the sensation
        of a fluffy, creamy fullness that may progress to a light, spritzy finish
        aided by high carbonation. Always effervescent.A pale, spicy, fruity, refreshing
        wheat-based ale. A traditional wheat-based ale originating in Southern Germany

        \ esters may also be present. A moderate aroma of alcohol is common, although\
        \ never solventy. No hop aroma, diacetyl or DMS.Dark amber to dark, ruby brown\
        \ in color. A very thick, moussy, long-lasting light tan head is characteristic.\
        \ The high protein content of wheat impairs clarity in this traditionally\
        \ unfiltered style, although the level of haze is somewhat variable. The suspended\
        \ yeast sediment (which should be roused before drinking) also contributes\
        \ to the cloudiness.A complex marriage of rich, bock-like melanoidins, dark\
        \ fruit, spicy clove-like phenols, light banana and/or vanilla, and a moderate\
        \ wheat flavor. The malty, bready flavor of wheat is further enhanced by the\
        \ copious use of Munich and/or Vienna malts. May have a slightly sweet palate,\
        \ and a light chocolate character is sometimes found (although a roasted character\
        \ is inappropriate). A faintly tart character may optionally be present. Hop\
        \ flavor is absent, and hop bitterness is low. The wheat, malt, and yeast\
        \ character dominate the palate, and the alcohol helps balance the finish.\
        \ Well-aged examples may show some sherry-like oxidation as a point of complexity.\
        \ No diacetyl or DMS.Medium-full to full body. A creamy sensation is typical,\
        \ as is the warming sensation of substantial alcohol content. The presence\
        \ of Munich and/or Vienna malts also provide an additional sense of richness\
        \ and fullness. Moderate to high carbonation. Never hot or solventy.A strong,\
        \ malty, fruity, wheat-based ale combining the best flavors of a dunkelweizen\
        \ and the rich strength and body of a bock. Aventinus, the world's oldest\
        \ top-fermented wheat doppelbock, was created in 1907 at the Weisse Brauhaus\
        \ in Munich using the 'M\xE9thode Champenoise' with fresh yeast sediment on\
        \ the bottom. It was Schneider's creative response to bottom-fermenting doppelbocks\
        \ that developed a strong following during these times."

    ingredients: "About 50% unmalted wheat (traditionally soft white winter wheat)\
        \ and 50% pale barley malt (usually Pils malt) constitute the grist. In some\
        \ versions, up to 5-10% raw oats may be used. Spices of freshly-ground coriander\
        \ and Cura\xE7ao or sometimes sweet orange peel complement the sweet aroma\
        \ and are quite characteristic. Other spices (e.g., chamomile, cumin, cinnamon,\

        \ Ale yeast prone to the production of mild, spicy flavors is very characteristic.\

    name: Witbier
    notes: The presence, character and degree of spicing and lactic sourness varies.
        Overly spiced and/or sour beers are not good examples of the style. Coriander
        of certain origins might give an inappropriate ham or celery character. The
        beer tends to be fragile and does not age well, so younger, fresher, properly
        handled examples are most desirable. Most examples seem to be approximately
        5% ABV.

    profile: Moderate sweetness (often with light notes of honey and/or vanilla) with
        light, grainy, spicy wheat aromatics, often with a bit of tartness. Moderate
        perfumy coriander, often with a complex herbal, spicy, or peppery note in
        the background. Moderate zesty, citrusy orangey fruitiness.  A low spicy-herbal
        hop aroma is optional, but should never overpower the other characteristics.
        No diacetyl. Vegetal, celery-like, or ham-like aromas are inappropriate. Spices
        should blend in with fruity, floral and sweet aromas and should not be overly
        strong.Very pale straw to very light gold in color. The beer will be very
        cloudy from starch haze and/or yeast, which gives it a milky, whitish-yellow
        appearance. Dense, white, moussy head. Head retention should be quite good.Pleasant
        sweetness (often with a honey and/or vanilla character) and a zesty, orange-citrusy
        fruitiness. Refreshingly crisp with a dry, often tart, finish. Can have a
        low wheat flavor. Optionally has a very light lactic-tasting sourness. Herbal-spicy
        flavors, which may include coriander and other spices, are common should be
        subtle and balanced, not overpowering. A spicy-earthy hop flavor is low to
        none, and if noticeable, never gets in the way of the spices. Hop bitterness
        is low to medium-low (as with a Hefeweizen), and doesn't interfere with refreshing
        flavors of fruit and spice, nor does it persist into the finish. Bitterness
        from orange pith should not be present. Vegetal, celery-like, ham-like, or
        soapy flavors are inappropriate. No diacetyl. Medium-light to medium body,
        often having a smoothness and light creaminess from unmalted wheat and the
        occasional oats. Despite body and creaminess, finishes dry and often a bit
        tart. Effervescent character from high carbonation. Refreshing, from carbonation,
        light acidity, and lack of bitterness in finish. No harshness or astringency
        from orange pith. Should not be overly dry and thin, nor should it be thick
        and heavy.A refreshing, elegant, tasty, moderate-strength wheat-based ale.
        A 400-year-old beer style that died out in the 1950s; it was later revived
        by Pierre Celis at Hoegaarden, and has grown steadily in popularity over time.

    ingredients: Varies with base style. Aged in wooden casks or barrels (often previously
        used to store whiskey, bourbon, port, sherry, Madeira, or wine), or using
        wood-based additives (wood chips, wood staves, oak essence). Fuller-bodied,
        higher-gravity base styles often are used since they can best stand up to
        the additional flavors, although experimentation is encouraged.
    name: Wood-Aged Beer
    notes: The base beer style should be apparent. The wood-based character should
        be evident, but not so dominant as to unbalance the beer. The intensity of
        the wood-based flavors is based on the contact time with the wood; the age,
        condition, and previous usage of the barrel; and the type of wood. Any additional
        alcoholic products previously stored in the wood should be evident (if declared
        as part of the entry), but should not be so dominant as to unbalance the beer.
        IF THIS BEER IS BASED ON A CLASSIC STYLE (E.G., ROBUST PORTER) THEN THE SPECIFIC
        STYLE MUST BE SPECIFIED. CLASSIC STYLES DO NOT HAVE TO BE CITED (E.G., "PORTER"
        OR "BROWN ALE" IS ACCEPTABLE). THE TYPE OF WOOD MUST BE SPECIFIED IF A "VARIETAL"
        CHARACTER IS NOTICEABLE. (e.g., English IPA with Oak Chips, Bourbon Barrel-aged
        Imperial Stout, American Barleywine in an Oak Whiskey Cask). The brewer should
        specify any unusual ingredients in either the base style or the wood if those
        characteristics are noticeable. Specialty or experimental base beer styles
        may be specified, as long as the other specialty ingredients are identified.
        THIS CATEGORY SHOULD NOT BE USED FOR BASE STYLES WHERE BARREL-AGING IS A FUNDAMENTAL
        REQUIREMENT FOR THE STYLE (e.g., Flanders Red, Lambic, etc.).
    og_max: 1.2
    og_min: 1.0
    profile: Varies with base style. A low to moderate wood- or oak-based aroma is
        usually present. Fresh wood can occasionally impart raw "green" aromatics,
        although this character should never be too strong. Other optional aromatics
        include a low to moderate vanilla, caramel, toffee, toast, or cocoa character,
        as well as any aromatics associated with alcohol previously stored in the
        wood (if any). Any alcohol character should be smooth and balanced, not hot.
        Some background oxidation character is optional, and can take on a pleasant,
        sherry-like character and not be papery or cardboard-like.Varies with base
        style. Often darker than the unadulterated base beer style, particularly if
        toasted/charred oak and/or whiskey/bourbon barrels are used.Varies with base
        style. Wood usually contributes a woody or oaky flavor, which can occasionally
        take on a raw "green" flavor if new wood is used. Other flavors that may optionally
        be present include vanilla (from vanillin in the wood,'); caramel, butterscotch,
        toasted bread or almonds (from toasted wood); coffee, chocolate, cocoa (from
        charred wood or bourbon casks); and alcohol flavors from other products previously
        stored in the wood (if any). The wood and/or other cask-derived flavors should
        be balanced, supportive and noticeable, but should not overpower the base
        beer style. Occasionally there may be an optional lactic or acetic tartness
        or Brett funkiness in the beer, but this should not be higher than a background
        flavor (if present at all). Some background oxidation character is optional,
        although this should take on a pleasant, sherry-like character and not be
        papery or cardboard-like.Varies with base style. Often fuller than the unadulterated
        base beer, and may exhibit additional alcohol warming if wood has previously
        been in contact with other alcoholic products. Higher alcohol levels should
        not result in "hot" beers; aged, smooth flavors are most desirable. Wood can
        also add tannins to the beer, depending on age of the cask. The tannins can
        lead to additional astringency (which should never be high), or simply a fuller
        mouthfeel. Tart or acidic characteristics should be low to none.A harmonious
        blend of the base beer style with characteristics from aging in contact with
        wood (including any alcoholic products previously in contact with the wood).
        The best examples will be smooth, flavorful, well-balanced and well-aged.
        Beers made using either limited wood aging or products that only provide a
        subtle background character may be entered in the base beer style categories
        as long as the wood character isn't prominently featured.  A traditional production
        method that is rarely used by major breweries, and usually only with specialty
        products. Becoming more popular with modern American craft breweries looking
        for new, distinctive products. Oak cask and barrels are traditional, although
        other woods can be used.

    ingredients: Pale ale malt, American hops (usually Northern Brewer, rather than
        citrusy varieties), small amounts of toasted malt and/or crystal malts. Lager
        yeast, however some strains (often with the mention of "California" in the
        name) work better than others at the warmer fermentation temperatures (55
        to 60F) used. Note that some German yeast strains produce inappropriate sulfury
        character. Water should have relatively low sulfate and low to moderate carbonate
        levels.
    name: California Common Beer
    notes: This style is narrowly defined around the prototypical Anchor Steam example.
        Superficially similar to an American pale or amber ale, yet differs in that
        the hop flavor/aroma is woody/minty rather than citrusy, malt flavors are
        toasty and caramelly, the hopping is always assertive, and a warm-fermented
        lager yeast is used.

    profile: Typically showcases the signature Northern Brewer hops (with woody, rustic
        or minty qualities) in moderate to high strength. Light fruitiness acceptable.
        Low to moderate caramel and/or toasty malt aromatics support the hops. No
        diacetyl.Medium amber to light copper color. Generally clear. Moderate off-white

        The malt character is usually toasty (not roasted) and caramelly. Low to moderately
        high hop flavor, usually showing Northern Brewer qualities (woody, rustic,
        minty). Finish fairly dry and crisp, with a lingering hop bitterness and a
        firm, grainy malt flavor. Light fruity esters are acceptable, but otherwise
        clean. No diacetyl.Medium-bodied. Medium to medium-high carbonation.A lightly
        fruity beer with firm, grainy maltiness, interesting toasty and caramel flavors,
        and showcasing the signature Northern Brewer varietal hop character. American
        West Coast original. Large shallow open fermenters (coolships) were traditionally
        used to compensate for the absence of refrigeration and to take advantage
        of the cool ambient temperatures in the San Francisco Bay area. Fermented
        with a lager yeast, but one that was selected to thrive at the cool end of
        normal ale fermentation temperatures.

    ingredients: Pale ale, amber, and/or crystal malts, may use a touch of black malt
        for color adjustment. May use sugar adjuncts, corn or wheat. English hops
        most typical, although American and European varieties are becoming more common
        (particularly in the paler examples). Characterful English yeast. "Burton"
        versions use medium to high sulfate water.
    name: Extra Special/Strong Bitter (English Pale Ale)
    notes: More evident malt and hop flavors than in a special or best bitter. Stronger
        versions may overlap somewhat with old ales, although strong bitters will
        tend to be paler and more bitter. Fuller's ESB is a unique beer with a very
        large, complex malt profile not found in other examples; most strong bitters
        are fruitier and hoppier. Judges should not judge all beers in this style
        as if they were Fuller's ESB clones. Some modern English variants are brewed
        exclusively with pale malt and are known as golden or summer bitters. Most
        bottled or kegged versions of UK-produced bitters are higher-alcohol versions
        of their cask (draught) products produced specifically for export. The IBU
        levels are often not adjusted, so the versions available in the US often do
        not directly correspond to their style subcategories in Britain. English pale
        ales are generally considered a premium, export-strength pale, bitter beer
        that roughly approximates a strong bitter, although reformulated for bottling
        (including containing higher carbonation).
    og_max: 1.06
    og_min: 1.048
    profile: Hop aroma moderately-high to moderately-low, and can use any variety
        of hops although UK hops are most traditional. Medium to medium-high malt
        aroma, often with a low to moderately strong caramel component (although this
        character will be more subtle in paler versions). Medium-low to medium-high
        fruity esters. Generally no diacetyl, although very low levels are allowed.  May
        have light, secondary notes of sulfur and/or alcohol in some examples (optional).Golden
        to deep copper. Good to brilliant clarity. Low to moderate white to off-white
        head. A low head is acceptable when carbonation is also low.Medium-high to
        medium bitterness with supporting malt flavors evident. Normally has a moderately
        low to somewhat strong caramelly malt sweetness. Hop flavor moderate to moderately
        high (any variety, although earthy, resiny, and/or floral UK hops are most
        traditional). Hop bitterness and flavor should be noticeable, but should not
        totally dominate malt flavors. May have low levels of secondary malt flavors
        (e.g., nutty, biscuity) adding complexity. Moderately-low to high fruity esters.
        Optionally may have low amounts of alcohol, and up to a moderate minerally/sulfury
        flavor. Medium-dry to dry finish (particularly if sulfate water is used).
        Generally no diacetyl, although very low levels are allowed.Medium-light to
        medium-full body. Low to moderate carbonation, although bottled commercial
        versions will be higher. Stronger versions may have a slight alcohol warmth
        but this character should not be too high.An average-strength to moderately-strong
        English ale. The balance may be fairly even between malt and hops to somewhat
        bitter. Drinkability is a critical component of the style; emphasis is still
        on the bittering hop addition as opposed to the aggressive middle and late
        hopping seen in American ales. A rather broad style that allows for considerable
        interpretation by the brewer. Strong bitters can be seen as a higher-gravity
        version of best bitters (although not necessarily "more premium" since best
        bitters are traditionally the brewer's finest product). Since beer is sold
        by strength in the UK, these beers often have some alcohol flavor (perhaps
        to let the consumer know they are getting their due). In England today, "ESB"
        is a brand unique to Fullers; in America, the name has been co-opted to describe
        a malty, bitter, reddish, standard-strength (for the US) English-type ale.
        Hopping can be English or a combination of English and American.

        optional peaty, earthy and/or smoky character comes from the traditional yeast
        and from the local malt and water rather than using smoked malts.
    name: Scottish Heavy 70/-
    notes: The malt-hop balance is slightly to moderately tilted towards the malt
        side. Any caramelization comes from kettle caramelization and not caramel
        malt (and is sometimes confused with diacetyl). Although unusual, any smoked
        character is yeast- or water-derived and not from the use of peat-smoked malts.
        Use of peat-smoked malt to replicate the peaty character should be restrained;
        overly smoky beers should be entered in the Other Smoked Beer category (22B)
        rather than here.

    profile: Low to medium malty sweetness, sometimes accentuated by low to moderate
        kettle caramelization. Some examples have a low hop aroma, light fruitiness,
        low diacetyl, and/or a low to moderate peaty aroma (all are optional). The
        peaty aroma is sometimes perceived as earthy, smoky or very lightly roasted.Deep
        amber to dark copper. Usually very clear due to long, cool fermentations.
        Low to moderate, creamy off-white to light tan-colored head.Malt is the primary
        flavor, but isn't overly strong. The initial malty sweetness is usually accentuated
        by a low to moderate kettle caramelization, and is sometimes accompanied by
        a low diacetyl component. Fruity esters may be moderate to none. Hop bitterness
        is low to moderate, but the balance will always be towards the malt (although
        not always by much). Hop flavor is low to none. A low to moderate peaty character
        is optional, and may be perceived as earthy or smoky. Generally has a grainy,
        dry finish due to small amounts of unmalted roasted barley.Medium-low to medium
        body. Low to moderate carbonation. Sometimes a bit creamy, but often quite
        dry due to use of roasted barley.Cleanly malty with a drying finish, perhaps
        a few esters, and on occasion a faint bit of peaty earthiness (smoke). Most
        beers finish fairly dry considering their relatively sweet palate, and as
        such have a different balance than strong Scotch ales. Traditional Scottish
        session beers reflecting the indigenous ingredients (water, malt), with less
        hops than their English counterparts (due to the need to import them). Long,
        cool fermentations are traditionally used in Scottish brewing.

    ingredients: Pale ale malt, typically American two-row. American hops, often but
        not always ones with a citrusy character. American ale yeast. Water can vary
        in sulfate content, but carbonate content should be relatively low. Specialty
        grains may add character and complexity, but generally make up a relatively
        small portion of the grist. Grains that add malt flavor and richness, light
        sweetness, and toasty or bready notes are often used (along with late hops)
        to differentiate brands.
    name: American Pale Ale
    notes: There is some overlap in color between American pale ale and American amber
        ale. The American pale ale will generally be cleaner, have a less caramelly
        malt profile, less body, and often more finishing hops.

    profile: Usually moderate to strong hop aroma from dry hopping or late kettle
        additions of American hop varieties. A citrusy hop character is very common,
        but not required. Low to moderate maltiness supports the hop presentation,
        and may optionally show small amounts of specialty malt character (bready,
        toasty, biscuity). Fruity esters vary from moderate to none. No diacetyl.
        Dry hopping (if used) may add grassy notes, although this character should
        not be excessive.Pale golden to deep amber. Moderately large white to off-white
        head with good retention. Generally quite clear, although dry-hopped versions
        may be slightly hazy.Usually a moderate to high hop flavor, often showing
        a citrusy American hop character (although other hop varieties may be used).
        Low to moderately high clean malt character supports the hop presentation,
        and may optionally show small amounts of specialty malt character (bready,
        toasty, biscuity). The balance is typically towards the late hops and bitterness,
        but the malt presence can be substantial. Caramel flavors are usually restrained
        or absent. Fruity esters can be moderate to none. Moderate to high hop bitterness
        with a medium to dry finish. Hop flavor and bitterness often lingers into
        the finish. No diacetyl. Dry hopping (if used) may add grassy notes, although
        this character should not be excessive.Medium-light to medium body. Carbonation
        moderate to high. Overall smooth finish without astringency often associated
        with high hopping rates.Refreshing and hoppy, yet with sufficient supporting
        malt. An American adaptation of English pale ale, reflecting indigenous ingredients
        (hops, malt, yeast, and water). Often lighter in color, cleaner in fermentation
        by-products, and having less caramel flavors than English counterparts.

    ingredients: May contain several malts, prominently dark roasted malts and grains,
        which often include black patent malt (chocolate malt and/or roasted barley
        may also be used in some versions). Hops are used for bittering, flavor and/or
        aroma, and are frequently UK or US varieties. Water with moderate to high
        carbonate hardness is typical. Ale yeast can either be clean US versions or
        characterful English varieties.
    name: Robust Porter
    notes: Although a rather broad style open to brewer interpretation, it may be
        distinguished from Stout as lacking a strong roasted barley character. It
        differs from a brown porter in that a black patent or roasted grain character
        is usually present, and it can be stronger in alcohol. Roast intensity and
        malt flavors can also vary significantly. May or may not have a strong hop
        character, and may or may not have significant fermentation by-products; thus
        may seem to have an "American" or "English" character.

        additional malt character in support (grainy, bready, toffee-like, caramelly,
        chocolate, coffee, rich, and/or sweet). Hop aroma low to high (US or UK varieties).
        Some American versions may be dry-hopped. Fruity esters are moderate to none.
        Diacetyl low to none.Medium brown to very dark brown, often with ruby- or
        garnet-like highlights. Can approach black in color. Clarity may be difficult
        to discern in such a dark beer, but when not opaque will be clear (particularly
        when held up to the light). Full, tan-colored head with moderately good head
        retention.Moderately strong malt flavor usually features a lightly burnt,
        black malt character (and sometimes chocolate and/or coffee flavors) with
        a bit of roasty dryness in the finish. Overall flavor may finish from dry
        to medium-sweet, depending on grist composition, hop bittering level, and
        attenuation. May have a sharp character from dark roasted grains, although
        should not be overly acrid, burnt or harsh. Medium to high bitterness, which
        can be accentuated by the roasted malt. Hop flavor can vary from low to moderately
        high (US or UK varieties, typically), and balances the roasted malt flavors.
        Diacetyl low to none. Fruity esters moderate to none.Medium to medium-full
        body. Moderately low to moderately high carbonation. Stronger versions may
        have a slight alcohol warmth. May have a slight astringency from roasted grains,

        with a complex and flavorful roasty character. Stronger, hoppier and/or roastier
        version of porter designed as either a historical throwback or an American
        interpretation of the style. Traditional versions will have a more subtle
        hop character (often English), while modern versions may be considerably more
        aggressive. Both types are equally valid.

    notes: Generally between sweet and dry stouts in sweetness. Variations exist,
        from fairly sweet to quite dry. The level of bitterness also varies, as does
        the oatmeal impression. Light use of oatmeal may give a certain silkiness

    profile: A prominent to intense hop aroma with a citrusy, floral, perfume-like,
        resinous, piney, and/or fruity character derived from American hops. Many
        versions are dry hopped and can have an additional grassy aroma, although
        this is not required. Some clean malty sweetness may be found in the background,
        but should be at a lower level than in English examples. Fruitiness, either
        from esters or hops, may also be detected in some versions, although a neutral
        fermentation character is also acceptable. Some alcohol may be noted.Color
        ranges from medium gold to medium reddish copper; some versions can have an
        orange-ish tint. Should be clear, although unfiltered dry-hopped versions
        may be a bit hazy. Good head stand with white to off-white color should persist.Hop
        flavor is medium to high, and should reflect an American hop character with
        citrusy, floral, resinous, piney or fruity aspects. Medium-high to very high
        hop bitterness, although the malt backbone will support the strong hop character
        and provide the best balance. Malt flavor should be low to medium, and is
        generally clean and malty sweet although some caramel or toasty flavors are
        acceptable at low levels. No diacetyl. Low fruitiness is acceptable but not
        required. The bitterness may linger into the aftertaste but should not be
        harsh. Medium-dry to dry finish. Some clean alcohol flavor can be noted in
        stronger versions. Oak is inappropriate in this style. May be slightly sulfury,
        but most examples do not exhibit this character.Smooth, medium-light to medium-bodied
        mouthfeel without hop-derived astringency, although moderate to medium-high
        carbonation can combine to render an overall dry sensation in the presence
        of malt sweetness. Some smooth alcohol warming can and should be sensed in

    ingredients: By German law, at least 50% of the grist must be malted wheat, although
        some versions use up to 70%; the remainder is Pilsner malt. A traditional
        decoction mash gives the appropriate body without cloying sweetness. Weizen
        ale yeasts produce the typical spicy and fruity character, although extreme
        fermentation temperatures can affect the balance and produce off-flavors.
        A small amount of noble hops are used only for bitterness.
    name: Weizen/Weissbier
    notes: These are refreshing, fast-maturing beers that are lightly hopped and show
        a unique banana-and-clove yeast character. These beers often don't age well
        and are best enjoyed while young and fresh. The version "mit hefe" is served
        with yeast sediment stirred in; the krystal version is filtered for excellent
        clarity. Bottles with yeast are traditionally swirled or gently rolled prior
        to serving. The character of a krystal weizen is generally fruitier and less
        phenolic than that of the hefe-weizen.
    og_max: 1.052
    og_min: 1.044
    profile: Moderate to strong phenols (usually clove) and fruity esters (usually
        banana). The balance and intensity of the phenol and ester components can
        vary but the best examples are reasonably balanced and fairly prominent. Noble
        hop character ranges from low to none. A light to moderate wheat aroma (which
        might be perceived as bready or grainy) may be present but other malt characteristics
        should not. No diacetyl or DMS. Optional, but acceptable, aromatics can include
        a light, citrusy tartness, a light to moderate vanilla character, and/or a
        low bubblegum aroma. None of these optional characteristics should be high
        or dominant, but often can add to the complexity and balance.Pale straw to
        very dark gold in color. A very thick, moussy, long-lasting white head is
        characteristic. The high protein content of wheat impairs clarity in an unfiltered
        beer, although the level of haze is somewhat variable. A beer "mit hefe" is
        also cloudy from suspended yeast sediment (which should be roused before drinking).
        The filtered Krystal version has no yeast and is brilliantly clear.Low to
        moderately strong banana and clove flavor. The balance and intensity of the
        phenol and ester components can vary but the best examples are reasonably
        balanced and fairly prominent. Optionally, a very light to moderate vanilla
        character and/or low bubblegum notes can accentuate the banana flavor, sweetness
        and roundness; neither should be dominant if present. The soft, somewhat bready
        or grainy flavor of wheat is complementary, as is a slightly sweet Pils malt
        character. Hop flavor is very low to none, and hop bitterness is very low
        to moderately low. A tart, citrusy character from yeast and high carbonation
        is often present. Well rounded, flavorful palate with a relatively dry finish.
        No diacetyl or DMS.Medium-light to medium body; never heavy. Suspended yeast
        may increase the perception of body. The texture of wheat imparts the sensation
        of a fluffy, creamy fullness that may progress to a light, spritzy finish
        aided by high carbonation. Always effervescent.A pale, spicy, fruity, refreshing
        wheat-based ale. A traditional wheat-based ale originating in Southern Germany
        that is a specialty for summer consumption, but generally produced year-round.

    ingredients: Pilsner malt dominates the grist though a portion of Vienna and/or
        Munich malt contributes color and complexity. Sometimes contains other grains
        such as wheat and spelt. Adjuncts such as sugar and honey can also serve to
        add complexity and thin the body. Hop bitterness and flavor may be more noticeable
        than in many other Belgian styles. A saison is sometimes dry-hopped. Noble
        hops, Styrian or East Kent Goldings are commonly used. A wide variety of herbs
        and spices are often used to add complexity and uniqueness in the stronger
        versions, but should always meld well with the yeast and hop character. Varying
        degrees of acidity and/or sourness can be created by the use of gypsum, acidulated
        malt, a sour mash or Lactobacillus. Hard water, common to most of Wallonia,
        can accentuate the bitterness and dry finish.
    name: Saison
    notes: Varying strength examples exist (table beers of about 5% strength, typical
        export beers of about 6.5%, and stronger versions of 8%+). Strong versions
        (6.5%-9.5%) and darker versions (copper to dark brown/black) should be entered
        as Belgian Specialty Ales (16E). Sweetness decreases and spice, hop and sour
        character increases with strength. Herb and spice additions often reflect
        the indigenous varieties available at the brewery. High carbonation and extreme
        attenuation (85-95%) helps bring out the many flavors and to increase the
        perception of a dry finish. All of these beers share somewhat higher levels
        of acidity than other Belgian styles while the optional sour flavor is often
        a variable house character of a particular brewery.

    profile: High fruitiness with low to moderate hop aroma and moderate to no herb,
        spice and alcohol aroma. Fruity esters dominate the aroma and are often reminiscent
        of citrus fruits such as oranges or lemons. A low to medium-high spicy or
        floral hop aroma is usually present. A moderate spice aroma (from actual spice
        additions and/or yeast-derived phenols) complements the other aromatics. When
        phenolics are present they tend to be peppery rather than clove-like. A low
        to moderate sourness or acidity may be present, but should not overwhelm other
        characteristics. Spice, hop and sour aromatics typically increase with the
        strength of the beer. Alcohols are soft, spicy and low in intensity, and should
        not be hot or solventy. The malt character is light. No diacetyl.Often a distinctive
        pale orange but may be golden or amber in color. There is no correlation between
        strength and color. Long-lasting, dense, rocky white to ivory head resulting
        in characteristic "Belgian lace" on the glass as it fades. Clarity is poor
        to good though haze is not unexpected in this type of unfiltered farmhouse
        beer. Effervescent.Combination of fruity and spicy flavors supported by a
        soft malt character, a low to moderate alcohol presence and tart sourness.
        Extremely high attenuation gives a characteristic dry finish. The fruitiness
        is frequently citrusy (orange- or lemon-like). The addition of one of more
        spices serve to add complexity, but shouldn't dominate in the balance. Low
        peppery yeast-derived phenols may be present instead of or in addition to
        spice additions; phenols tend to be lower than in many other Belgian beers,
        and complement the bitterness. Hop flavor is low to moderate, and is generally
        spicy or earthy in character. Hop bitterness may be moderate to high, but
        should not overwhelm fruity esters, spices, and malt. Malt character is light
        but provides a sufficient background for the other flavors. A low to moderate
        tart sourness may be present, but should not overwhelm other flavors. Spices,
        hop bitterness and flavor, and sourness commonly increase with the strength
        of the beer while sweetness decreases. No hot alcohol or solventy character.
        High carbonation, moderately sulfate water, and high attenuation give a very
        dry finish with a long, bitter, sometimes spicy aftertaste. The perceived
        bitterness is often higher than the IBU level would suggest. No diacetyl.Light
        to medium body. Alcohol level can be medium to medium-high, though the warming
        character is low to medium. No hot alcohol or solventy character. Very high
        carbonation with an effervescent quality. There is enough prickly acidity
        on the tongue to balance the very dry finish. A low to moderate tart character
        may be present but should be refreshing and not to the point of puckering.A
        refreshing, medium to strong fruity/spicy ale with a distinctive yellow-orange
        color, highly carbonated, well hopped, and dry with a quenching acidity. A
        seasonal summer style produced in Wallonia, the French-speaking part of Belgium.
        Originally brewed at the end of the cool season to last through the warmer
        months before refrigeration was common. It had to be sturdy enough to last
        for months but not too strong to be quenching and refreshing in the summer.
        It is now brewed year-round in tiny, artisanal breweries whose buildings reflect
        their origins as farmhouses.

    ingredients: Wheat malt content is typically 50% of the grist (as with all German
        wheat beers) with the remainder being Pilsner malt. A symbiotic fermentation
        with top-fermenting yeast and Lactobacillus delbruckii provides the sharp
        sourness, which may be enhanced by blending of beers of different ages during
        fermentation and by extended cool aging. Hop bitterness is extremely low.
        A single decoction mash with mash hopping is traditional.
    name: Berliner Weisse
    notes: In Germany, it is classified as a Schankbier denoting a small beer of starting
        gravity in the range 7-8P. Often served with the addition of a shot of sugar
        syrups ('mit schuss') flavored with raspberry ('himbeer') or woodruff ('waldmeister')
        or even mixed with Pils to counter the substantial sourness. Has been described
        by some as the most purely refreshing beer in the world.

    profile: A sharply sour, somewhat acidic character is dominant. Can have up to
        a moderately fruity character. The fruitiness may increase with age and a
        flowery character may develop. A mild Brettanomyces aroma may be present.
        No hop aroma, diacetyl, or DMS.Very pale straw in color. Clarity ranges from
        clear to somewhat hazy. Large, dense, white head with poor retention due to
        high acidity and low protein and hop content. Always effervescent.Clean lactic
        sourness dominates and can be quite strong, although not so acidic as a lambic.
        Some complementary bready or grainy wheat flavor is generally noticeable.
        Hop bitterness is very low. A mild Brettanomyces character may be detected,
        as may a restrained fruitiness (both are optional). No hop flavor. No diacetyl
        or DMS.Light body. Very dry finish. Very high carbonation. No sensation of
        alcohol.A very pale, sour, refreshing, low-alcohol wheat ale. A regional specialty
        of Berlin; referred to by Napoleon's troops in 1809 as "the Champagne of the
        North" due to its lively and elegant character. Only two traditional breweries
        still produce the product.

    ingredients: Belgian Pils malt, aromatic malts, sugar, Belgian yeast strains that
        produce complex alcohol, phenolics and perfumy esters, noble, Styrian Goldings
        or East Kent Goldings hops. No spices are traditionally used, although the
        ingredients and fermentation by-products may give an impression of spicing
        (often reminiscent of oranges or lemons).
    name: Belgian Blond Ale
    notes: Similar strength as a dubbel, similar character as a Belgian Strong Golden
        Ale or Tripel, although a bit sweeter and not as bitter. Often has an almost
        lager-like character, which gives it a cleaner profile in comparison to the
        other styles. Belgians use the term "Blond," while the French spell it "Blonde."
        Most commercial examples are in the 6.5 - 7% ABV range. Many Trappist table
        beers (singles or Enkels) are called "Blond" but these are not representative
        of this style.

    ingredients: Well-modified pale malt should form the backbone of the grist. Some
        specialty or character malts may be used. Dark malts should be used with great
        restraint, if at all, as most of the color arises from a lengthy boil.  Citrusy
        American hops are common, although any varieties can be used in quantity.
        Generally uses an attenuative American yeast.
    name: American Barleywine
    notes: The American version of the Barleywine tends to have a greater emphasis
        on hop bitterness, flavor and aroma than the English Barleywine, and often
        features American hop varieties. Differs from an Imperial IPA in that the
        hops are not extreme, the malt is more forward, and the body is richer and
        more characterful.
    og_max: 1.12

    profile: Very rich and intense maltiness. Hop character moderate to assertive
        and often showcases citrusy or resiny American varieties (although other varieties,
        such as floral, earthy or spicy English varieties or a blend of varieties,
        may be used). Low to moderately strong fruity esters and alcohol aromatics.
        Malt character may be sweet, caramelly, bready, or fairly neutral. However,
        the intensity of aromatics often subsides with age. No diacetyl.Color may
        range from light amber to medium copper; may rarely be as dark as light brown.
        Often has ruby highlights. Moderately-low to large off-white to light tan
        head; may have low head retention. May be cloudy with chill haze at cooler
        temperatures, but generally clears to good to brilliant clarity as it warms.
        The color may appear to have great depth, as if viewed through a thick glass
        lens. High alcohol and viscosity may be visible in "legs" when beer is swirled
        in a glass.Strong, intense malt flavor with noticeable bitterness. Moderately
        low to moderately high malty sweetness on the palate, although the finish
        may be somewhat sweet to quite dry (depending on aging). Hop bitterness may
        range from moderately strong to aggressive. While strongly malty, the balance
        should always seem bitter. Moderate to high hop flavor (any variety). Low
        to moderate fruity esters. Noticeable alcohol presence, but sharp or solventy
        alcohol flavors are undesirable. Flavors will smooth out and decline over
        time, but any oxidized character should be muted (and generally be masked
        by the hop character). May have some bready or caramelly malt flavors, but
        these should not be high. Roasted or burnt malt flavors are inappropriate.
        No diacetyl.Full-bodied and chewy, with a velvety, luscious texture (although
        the body may decline with long conditioning). Alcohol warmth should be present,
        but not be excessively hot. Should not be syrupy and under-attenuated. Carbonation
        may be low to moderate, depending on age and conditioning.A well-hopped American
        interpretation of the richest and strongest of the English ales. The hop character
        should be evident throughout, but does not have to be unbalanced. The alcohol
        strength and hop bitterness often combine to leave a very long finish. Usually
        the strongest ale offered by a brewery, and in recent years many commercial
        examples are now vintage-dated. Normally aged significantly prior to release.
        Often associated with the winter or holiday season.

    ingredients: Pale ale malt, American hops (usually Northern Brewer, rather than
        citrusy varieties), small amounts of toasted malt and/or crystal malts. Lager
        yeast, however some strains (often with the mention of "California" in the
        name) work better than others at the warmer fermentation temperatures (55
        to 60F) used. Note that some German yeast strains produce inappropriate sulfury
        character. Water should have relatively low sulfate and low to moderate carbonate
        levels.
    name: California Common Beer
    notes: This style is narrowly defined around the prototypical Anchor Steam example.
        Superficially similar to an American pale or amber ale, yet differs in that
        the hop flavor/aroma is woody/minty rather than citrusy, malt flavors are
        toasty and caramelly, the hopping is always assertive, and a warm-fermented
        lager yeast is used.

        minty). Finish fairly dry and crisp, with a lingering hop bitterness and a
        firm, grainy malt flavor. Light fruity esters are acceptable, but otherwise
        clean. No diacetyl.Medium-bodied. Medium to medium-high carbonation.A lightly
        fruity beer with firm, grainy maltiness, interesting toasty and caramel flavors,
        and showcasing the signature Northern Brewer varietal hop character. American
        West Coast original. Large shallow open fermenters (coolships) were traditionally
        used to compensate for the absence of refrigeration and to take advantage
        of the cool ambient temperatures in the San Francisco Bay area. Fermented
        with a lager yeast, but one that was selected to thrive at the cool end of
        normal ale fermentation temperatures.

    ingredients: Pale ale, amber, and/or crystal malts, may use a touch of black malt
        for color adjustment. May use sugar adjuncts, corn or wheat. English hops
        most typical, although American and European varieties are becoming more common
        (particularly in the paler examples). Characterful English yeast. "Burton"
        versions use medium to high sulfate water.
    name: Extra Special/Strong Bitter (English Pale Ale)
    notes: More evident malt and hop flavors than in a special or best bitter. Stronger
        versions may overlap somewhat with old ales, although strong bitters will
        tend to be paler and more bitter. Fuller's ESB is a unique beer with a very
        large, complex malt profile not found in other examples; most strong bitters
        are fruitier and hoppier. Judges should not judge all beers in this style
        as if they were Fuller's ESB clones. Some modern English variants are brewed
        exclusively with pale malt and are known as golden or summer bitters. Most
        bottled or kegged versions of UK-produced bitters are higher-alcohol versions
        of their cask (draught) products produced specifically for export. The IBU
        levels are often not adjusted, so the versions available in the US often do
        not directly correspond to their style subcategories in Britain. English pale
        ales are generally considered a premium, export-strength pale, bitter beer
        that roughly approximates a strong bitter, although reformulated for bottling
        (including containing higher carbonation).

    profile: Hop aroma moderately-high to moderately-low, and can use any variety
        of hops although UK hops are most traditional. Medium to medium-high malt
        aroma, often with a low to moderately strong caramel component (although this
        character will be more subtle in paler versions). Medium-low to medium-high
        fruity esters. Generally no diacetyl, although very low levels are allowed.  May
        have light, secondary notes of sulfur and/or alcohol in some examples (optional).Golden
        to deep copper. Good to brilliant clarity. Low to moderate white to off-white
        head. A low head is acceptable when carbonation is also low.Medium-high to
        medium bitterness with supporting malt flavors evident. Normally has a moderately
        low to somewhat strong caramelly malt sweetness. Hop flavor moderate to moderately
        high (any variety, although earthy, resiny, and/or floral UK hops are most
        traditional). Hop bitterness and flavor should be noticeable, but should not
        totally dominate malt flavors. May have low levels of secondary malt flavors
        (e.g., nutty, biscuity) adding complexity. Moderately-low to high fruity esters.
        Optionally may have low amounts of alcohol, and up to a moderate minerally/sulfury
        flavor. Medium-dry to dry finish (particularly if sulfate water is used).
        Generally no diacetyl, although very low levels are allowed.Medium-light to
        medium-full body. Low to moderate carbonation, although bottled commercial
        versions will be higher. Stronger versions may have a slight alcohol warmth
        but this character should not be too high.An average-strength to moderately-strong
        English ale. The balance may be fairly even between malt and hops to somewhat
        bitter. Drinkability is a critical component of the style; emphasis is still
        on the bittering hop addition as opposed to the aggressive middle and late
        hopping seen in American ales. A rather broad style that allows for considerable
        interpretation by the brewer. Strong bitters can be seen as a higher-gravity
        version of best bitters (although not necessarily "more premium" since best
        bitters are traditionally the brewer's finest product). Since beer is sold
        by strength in the UK, these beers often have some alcohol flavor (perhaps
        to let the consumer know they are getting their due). In England today, "ESB"
        is a brand unique to Fullers; in America, the name has been co-opted to describe
        a malty, bitter, reddish, standard-strength (for the US) English-type ale.
        Hopping can be English or a combination of English and American.

    ingredients: Scottish or English pale base malt. Small amounts of roasted barley
        add color and flavor, and lend a dry, slightly roasty finish. English hops.
        Clean, relatively un-attenuative ale yeast. Some commercial brewers add small
        amounts of crystal, amber, or wheat malts, and adjuncts such as sugar. The
        optional peaty, earthy and/or smoky character comes from the traditional yeast
        and from the local malt and water rather than using smoked malts.
    name: Scottish Heavy 70/-
    notes: The malt-hop balance is slightly to moderately tilted towards the malt
        side. Any caramelization comes from kettle caramelization and not caramel
        malt (and is sometimes confused with diacetyl). Although unusual, any smoked
        character is yeast- or water-derived and not from the use of peat-smoked malts.
        Use of peat-smoked malt to replicate the peaty character should be restrained;
        overly smoky beers should be entered in the Other Smoked Beer category (22B)
        rather than here.

    profile: Low to medium malty sweetness, sometimes accentuated by low to moderate
        kettle caramelization. Some examples have a low hop aroma, light fruitiness,
        low diacetyl, and/or a low to moderate peaty aroma (all are optional). The
        peaty aroma is sometimes perceived as earthy, smoky or very lightly roasted.Deep
        amber to dark copper. Usually very clear due to long, cool fermentations.
        Low to moderate, creamy off-white to light tan-colored head.Malt is the primary
        flavor, but isn't overly strong. The initial malty sweetness is usually accentuated
        by a low to moderate kettle caramelization, and is sometimes accompanied by
        a low diacetyl component. Fruity esters may be moderate to none. Hop bitterness
        is low to moderate, but the balance will always be towards the malt (although
        not always by much). Hop flavor is low to none. A low to moderate peaty character
        is optional, and may be perceived as earthy or smoky. Generally has a grainy,
        dry finish due to small amounts of unmalted roasted barley.Medium-low to medium
        body. Low to moderate carbonation. Sometimes a bit creamy, but often quite
        dry due to use of roasted barley.Cleanly malty with a drying finish, perhaps
        a few esters, and on occasion a faint bit of peaty earthiness (smoke). Most
        beers finish fairly dry considering their relatively sweet palate, and as
        such have a different balance than strong Scotch ales. Traditional Scottish
        session beers reflecting the indigenous ingredients (water, malt), with less
        hops than their English counterparts (due to the need to import them). Long,
        cool fermentations are traditionally used in Scottish brewing.

    ingredients: Pale ale malt, typically American two-row. American hops, often but
        not always ones with a citrusy character. American ale yeast. Water can vary
        in sulfate content, but carbonate content should be relatively low. Specialty
        grains may add character and complexity, but generally make up a relatively
        small portion of the grist. Grains that add malt flavor and richness, light
        sweetness, and toasty or bready notes are often used (along with late hops)
        to differentiate brands.
    name: American Pale Ale
    notes: There is some overlap in color between American pale ale and American amber
        ale. The American pale ale will generally be cleaner, have a less caramelly
        malt profile, less body, and often more finishing hops.
    og_max: 1.06
    og_min: 1.045
    profile: Usually moderate to strong hop aroma from dry hopping or late kettle
        additions of American hop varieties. A citrusy hop character is very common,
        but not required. Low to moderate maltiness supports the hop presentation,
        and may optionally show small amounts of specialty malt character (bready,
        toasty, biscuity). Fruity esters vary from moderate to none. No diacetyl.
        Dry hopping (if used) may add grassy notes, although this character should
        not be excessive.Pale golden to deep amber. Moderately large white to off-white
        head with good retention. Generally quite clear, although dry-hopped versions
        may be slightly hazy.Usually a moderate to high hop flavor, often showing
        a citrusy American hop character (although other hop varieties may be used).
        Low to moderately high clean malt character supports the hop presentation,
        and may optionally show small amounts of specialty malt character (bready,
        toasty, biscuity). The balance is typically towards the late hops and bitterness,
        but the malt presence can be substantial. Caramel flavors are usually restrained
        or absent. Fruity esters can be moderate to none. Moderate to high hop bitterness
        with a medium to dry finish. Hop flavor and bitterness often lingers into
        the finish. No diacetyl. Dry hopping (if used) may add grassy notes, although
        this character should not be excessive.Medium-light to medium body. Carbonation
        moderate to high. Overall smooth finish without astringency often associated
        with high hopping rates.Refreshing and hoppy, yet with sufficient supporting
        malt. An American adaptation of English pale ale, reflecting indigenous ingredients
        (hops, malt, yeast, and water). Often lighter in color, cleaner in fermentation
        by-products, and having less caramel flavors than English counterparts.

    ingredients: May contain several malts, prominently dark roasted malts and grains,
        which often include black patent malt (chocolate malt and/or roasted barley
        may also be used in some versions). Hops are used for bittering, flavor and/or
        aroma, and are frequently UK or US varieties. Water with moderate to high
        carbonate hardness is typical. Ale yeast can either be clean US versions or
        characterful English varieties.
    name: Robust Porter
    notes: Although a rather broad style open to brewer interpretation, it may be
        distinguished from Stout as lacking a strong roasted barley character. It
        differs from a brown porter in that a black patent or roasted grain character
        is usually present, and it can be stronger in alcohol. Roast intensity and
        malt flavors can also vary significantly. May or may not have a strong hop
        character, and may or may not have significant fermentation by-products; thus
        may seem to have an "American" or "English" character.

    profile: Roasty aroma (often with a lightly burnt, black malt character) should
        be noticeable and may be moderately strong. Optionally may also show some
        additional malt character in support (grainy, bready, toffee-like, caramelly,
        chocolate, coffee, rich, and/or sweet). Hop aroma low to high (US or UK varieties).
        Some American versions may be dry-hopped. Fruity esters are moderate to none.
        Diacetyl low to none.Medium brown to very dark brown, often with ruby- or
        garnet-like highlights. Can approach black in color. Clarity may be difficult
        to discern in such a dark beer, but when not opaque will be clear (particularly
        when held up to the light). Full, tan-colored head with moderately good head
        retention.Moderately strong malt flavor usually features a lightly burnt,
        black malt character (and sometimes chocolate and/or coffee flavors) with
        a bit of roasty dryness in the finish. Overall flavor may finish from dry
        to medium-sweet, depending on grist composition, hop bittering level, and
        attenuation. May have a sharp character from dark roasted grains, although
        should not be overly acrid, burnt or harsh. Medium to high bitterness, which
        can be accentuated by the roasted malt. Hop flavor can vary from low to moderately
        high (US or UK varieties, typically), and balances the roasted malt flavors.
        Diacetyl low to none. Fruity esters moderate to none.Medium to medium-full
        body. Moderately low to moderately high carbonation. Stronger versions may
        have a slight alcohol warmth. May have a slight astringency from roasted grains,
        although this character should not be strong.A substantial, malty dark ale
        with a complex and flavorful roasty character. Stronger, hoppier and/or roastier
        version of porter designed as either a historical throwback or an American
        interpretation of the style. Traditional versions will have a more subtle
        hop character (often English), while modern versions may be considerably more
        aggressive. Both types are equally valid.

    profile: A prominent to intense hop aroma with a citrusy, floral, perfume-like,
        resinous, piney, and/or fruity character derived from American hops. Many
        versions are dry hopped and can have an additional grassy aroma, although
        this is not required. Some clean malty sweetness may be found in the background,
        but should be at a lower level than in English examples. Fruitiness, either
        from esters or hops, may also be detected in some versions, although a neutral
        fermentation character is also acceptable. Some alcohol may be noted.Color
        ranges from medium gold to medium reddish copper; some versions can have an
        orange-ish tint. Should be clear, although unfiltered dry-hopped versions
        may be a bit hazy. Good head stand with white to off-white color should persist.Hop
        flavor is medium to high, and should reflect an American hop character with
        citrusy, floral, resinous, piney or fruity aspects. Medium-high to very high
        hop bitterness, although the malt backbone will support the strong hop character
        and provide the best balance. Malt flavor should be low to medium, and is
        generally clean and malty sweet although some caramel or toasty flavors are
        acceptable at low levels. No diacetyl. Low fruitiness is acceptable but not
        required. The bitterness may linger into the aftertaste but should not be
        harsh. Medium-dry to dry finish. Some clean alcohol flavor can be noted in
        stronger versions. Oak is inappropriate in this style. May be slightly sulfury,
        but most examples do not exhibit this character.Smooth, medium-light to medium-bodied
        mouthfeel without hop-derived astringency, although moderate to medium-high
        carbonation can combine to render an overall dry sensation in the presence
        of malt sweetness. Some smooth alcohol warming can and should be sensed in
        stronger (but not all) versions. Body is generally less than in English counterparts.A
        decidedly hoppy and bitter, moderately strong American pale ale. An American
        version of the historical English style, brewed using American ingredients
        and attitude.

    ingredients: By German law, at least 50% of the grist must be malted wheat, although
        some versions use up to 70%; the remainder is Pilsner malt. A traditional
        decoction mash gives the appropriate body without cloying sweetness. Weizen
        ale yeasts produce the typical spicy and fruity character, although extreme
        fermentation temperatures can affect the balance and produce off-flavors.
        A small amount of noble hops are used only for bitterness.
    name: Weizen/Weissbier
    notes: These are refreshing, fast-maturing beers that are lightly hopped and show
        a unique banana-and-clove yeast character. These beers often don't age well
        and are best enjoyed while young and fresh. The version "mit hefe" is served
        with yeast sediment stirred in; the krystal version is filtered for excellent
        clarity. Bottles with yeast are traditionally swirled or gently rolled prior
        to serving. The character of a krystal weizen is generally fruitier and less
        phenolic than that of the hefe-weizen.

    profile: Moderate to strong phenols (usually clove) and fruity esters (usually
        banana). The balance and intensity of the phenol and ester components can
        vary but the best examples are reasonably balanced and fairly prominent. Noble
        hop character ranges from low to none. A light to moderate wheat aroma (which
        might be perceived as bready or grainy) may be present but other malt characteristics
        should not. No diacetyl or DMS. Optional, but acceptable, aromatics can include
        a light, citrusy tartness, a light to moderate vanilla character, and/or a
        low bubblegum aroma. None of these optional characteristics should be high
        or dominant, but often can add to the complexity and balance.Pale straw to
        very dark gold in color. A very thick, moussy, long-lasting white head is
        characteristic. The high protein content of wheat impairs clarity in an unfiltered
        beer, although the level of haze is somewhat variable. A beer "mit hefe" is
        also cloudy from suspended yeast sediment (which should be roused before drinking).
        The filtered Krystal version has no yeast and is brilliantly clear.Low to
        moderately strong banana and clove flavor. The balance and intensity of the
        phenol and ester components can vary but the best examples are reasonably
        balanced and fairly prominent. Optionally, a very light to moderate vanilla
        character and/or low bubblegum notes can accentuate the banana flavor, sweetness
        and roundness; neither should be dominant if present. The soft, somewhat bready
        or grainy flavor of wheat is complementary, as is a slightly sweet Pils malt
        character. Hop flavor is very low to none, and hop bitterness is very low
        to moderately low. A tart, citrusy character from yeast and high carbonation
        is often present. Well rounded, flavorful palate with a relatively dry finish.
        No diacetyl or DMS.Medium-light to medium body; never heavy. Suspended yeast
        may increase the perception of body. The texture of wheat imparts the sensation
        of a fluffy, creamy fullness that may progress to a light, spritzy finish
        aided by high carbonation. Always effervescent.A pale, spicy, fruity, refreshing
        wheat-based ale. A traditional wheat-based ale originating in Southern Germany
        that is a specialty for summer consumption, but generally produced year-round.

    ingredients: Pilsner malt dominates the grist though a portion of Vienna and/or
        Munich malt contributes color and complexity. Sometimes contains other grains
        such as wheat and spelt. Adjuncts such as sugar and honey can also serve to
        add complexity and thin the body. Hop bitterness and flavor may be more noticeable
        than in many other Belgian styles. A saison is sometimes dry-hopped. Noble
        hops, Styrian or East Kent Goldings are commonly used. A wide variety of herbs
        and spices are often used to add complexity and uniqueness in the stronger
        versions, but should always meld well with the yeast and hop character. Varying
        degrees of acidity and/or sourness can be created by the use of gypsum, acidulated
        malt, a sour mash or Lactobacillus. Hard water, common to most of Wallonia,
        can accentuate the bitterness and dry finish.
    name: Saison
    notes: Varying strength examples exist (table beers of about 5% strength, typical
        export beers of about 6.5%, and stronger versions of 8%+). Strong versions
        (6.5%-9.5%) and darker versions (copper to dark brown/black) should be entered
        as Belgian Specialty Ales (16E). Sweetness decreases and spice, hop and sour
        character increases with strength. Herb and spice additions often reflect
        the indigenous varieties available at the brewery. High carbonation and extreme
        attenuation (85-95%) helps bring out the many flavors and to increase the
        perception of a dry finish. All of these beers share somewhat higher levels
        of acidity than other Belgian styles while the optional sour flavor is often
        a variable house character of a particular brewery.
    og_max: 1.065

    profile: High fruitiness with low to moderate hop aroma and moderate to no herb,
        spice and alcohol aroma. Fruity esters dominate the aroma and are often reminiscent
        of citrus fruits such as oranges or lemons. A low to medium-high spicy or
        floral hop aroma is usually present. A moderate spice aroma (from actual spice
        additions and/or yeast-derived phenols) complements the other aromatics. When
        phenolics are present they tend to be peppery rather than clove-like. A low
        to moderate sourness or acidity may be present, but should not overwhelm other
        characteristics. Spice, hop and sour aromatics typically increase with the
        strength of the beer. Alcohols are soft, spicy and low in intensity, and should
        not be hot or solventy. The malt character is light. No diacetyl.Often a distinctive
        pale orange but may be golden or amber in color. There is no correlation between
        strength and color. Long-lasting, dense, rocky white to ivory head resulting
        in characteristic "Belgian lace" on the glass as it fades. Clarity is poor
        to good though haze is not unexpected in this type of unfiltered farmhouse
        beer. Effervescent.Combination of fruity and spicy flavors supported by a
        soft malt character, a low to moderate alcohol presence and tart sourness.
        Extremely high attenuation gives a characteristic dry finish. The fruitiness
        is frequently citrusy (orange- or lemon-like). The addition of one of more
        spices serve to add complexity, but shouldn't dominate in the balance. Low
        peppery yeast-derived phenols may be present instead of or in addition to
        spice additions; phenols tend to be lower than in many other Belgian beers,
        and complement the bitterness. Hop flavor is low to moderate, and is generally
        spicy or earthy in character. Hop bitterness may be moderate to high, but
        should not overwhelm fruity esters, spices, and malt. Malt character is light
        but provides a sufficient background for the other flavors. A low to moderate
        tart sourness may be present, but should not overwhelm other flavors. Spices,
        hop bitterness and flavor, and sourness commonly increase with the strength
        of the beer while sweetness decreases. No hot alcohol or solventy character.
        High carbonation, moderately sulfate water, and high attenuation give a very
        dry finish with a long, bitter, sometimes spicy aftertaste. The perceived
        bitterness is often higher than the IBU level would suggest. No diacetyl.Light
        to medium body. Alcohol level can be medium to medium-high, though the warming
        character is low to medium. No hot alcohol or solventy character. Very high
        carbonation with an effervescent quality. There is enough prickly acidity
        on the tongue to balance the very dry finish. A low to moderate tart character
        may be present but should be refreshing and not to the point of puckering.A
        refreshing, medium to strong fruity/spicy ale with a distinctive yellow-orange
        color, highly carbonated, well hopped, and dry with a quenching acidity. A
        seasonal summer style produced in Wallonia, the French-speaking part of Belgium.
        Originally brewed at the end of the cool season to last through the warmer
        months before refrigeration was common. It had to be sturdy enough to last
        for months but not too strong to be quenching and refreshing in the summer.
        It is now brewed year-round in tiny, artisanal breweries whose buildings reflect
        their origins as farmhouses.

    ingredients: Wheat malt content is typically 50% of the grist (as with all German
        wheat beers) with the remainder being Pilsner malt. A symbiotic fermentation
        with top-fermenting yeast and Lactobacillus delbruckii provides the sharp
        sourness, which may be enhanced by blending of beers of different ages during
        fermentation and by extended cool aging. Hop bitterness is extremely low.
        A single decoction mash with mash hopping is traditional.
    name: Berliner Weisse
    notes: In Germany, it is classified as a Schankbier denoting a small beer of starting
        gravity in the range 7-8P. Often served with the addition of a shot of sugar
        syrups ('mit schuss') flavored with raspberry ('himbeer') or woodruff ('waldmeister')
        or even mixed with Pils to counter the substantial sourness. Has been described
        by some as the most purely refreshing beer in the world.

    profile: A sharply sour, somewhat acidic character is dominant. Can have up to
        a moderately fruity character. The fruitiness may increase with age and a
        flowery character may develop. A mild Brettanomyces aroma may be present.
        No hop aroma, diacetyl, or DMS.Very pale straw in color. Clarity ranges from
        clear to somewhat hazy. Large, dense, white head with poor retention due to
        high acidity and low protein and hop content. Always effervescent.Clean lactic
        sourness dominates and can be quite strong, although not so acidic as a lambic.
        Some complementary bready or grainy wheat flavor is generally noticeable.
        Hop bitterness is very low. A mild Brettanomyces character may be detected,
        as may a restrained fruitiness (both are optional). No hop flavor. No diacetyl
        or DMS.Light body. Very dry finish. Very high carbonation. No sensation of
        alcohol.A very pale, sour, refreshing, low-alcohol wheat ale. A regional specialty
        of Berlin; referred to by Napoleon's troops in 1809 as "the Champagne of the
        North" due to its lively and elegant character. Only two traditional breweries
        still produce the product.

    ingredients: Belgian Pils malt, aromatic malts, sugar, Belgian yeast strains that
        produce complex alcohol, phenolics and perfumy esters, noble, Styrian Goldings
        or East Kent Goldings hops. No spices are traditionally used, although the
        ingredients and fermentation by-products may give an impression of spicing
        (often reminiscent of oranges or lemons).
    name: Belgian Blond Ale
    notes: Similar strength as a dubbel, similar character as a Belgian Strong Golden
        Ale or Tripel, although a bit sweeter and not as bitter. Often has an almost
        lager-like character, which gives it a cleaner profile in comparison to the
        other styles. Belgians use the term "Blond," while the French spell it "Blonde."
        Most commercial examples are in the 6.5 - 7% ABV range. Many Trappist table
        beers (singles or Enkels) are called "Blond" but these are not representative
        of this style.

    ingredients: Well-modified pale malt should form the backbone of the grist. Some
        specialty or character malts may be used. Dark malts should be used with great
        restraint, if at all, as most of the color arises from a lengthy boil.  Citrusy
        American hops are common, although any varieties can be used in quantity.
        Generally uses an attenuative American yeast.
    name: American Barleywine
    notes: The American version of the Barleywine tends to have a greater emphasis
        on hop bitterness, flavor and aroma than the English Barleywine, and often
        features American hop varieties. Differs from an Imperial IPA in that the
        hops are not extreme, the malt is more forward, and the body is richer and
        more characterful.
    og_max: 1.12

    profile: Very rich and intense maltiness. Hop character moderate to assertive
        and often showcases citrusy or resiny American varieties (although other varieties,
        such as floral, earthy or spicy English varieties or a blend of varieties,
        may be used). Low to moderately strong fruity esters and alcohol aromatics.
        Malt character may be sweet, caramelly, bready, or fairly neutral. However,
        the intensity of aromatics often subsides with age. No diacetyl.Color may
        range from light amber to medium copper; may rarely be as dark as light brown.
        Often has ruby highlights. Moderately-low to large off-white to light tan
        head; may have low head retention. May be cloudy with chill haze at cooler
        temperatures, but generally clears to good to brilliant clarity as it warms.
        The color may appear to have great depth, as if viewed through a thick glass
        lens. High alcohol and viscosity may be visible in "legs" when beer is swirled
        in a glass.Strong, intense malt flavor with noticeable bitterness. Moderately
        low to moderately high malty sweetness on the palate, although the finish
        may be somewhat sweet to quite dry (depending on aging). Hop bitterness may
        range from moderately strong to aggressive. While strongly malty, the balance
        should always seem bitter. Moderate to high hop flavor (any variety). Low
        to moderate fruity esters. Noticeable alcohol presence, but sharp or solventy
        alcohol flavors are undesirable. Flavors will smooth out and decline over
        time, but any oxidized character should be muted (and generally be masked
        by the hop character). May have some bready or caramelly malt flavors, but
        these should not be high. Roasted or burnt malt flavors are inappropriate.
        No diacetyl.Full-bodied and chewy, with a velvety, luscious texture (although
        the body may decline with long conditioning). Alcohol warmth should be present,
        but not be excessively hot. Should not be syrupy and under-attenuated. Carbonation
        may be low to moderate, depending on age and conditioning.A well-hopped American
        interpretation of the richest and strongest of the English ales. The hop character
        should be evident throughout, but does not have to be unbalanced. The alcohol
        strength and hop bitterness often combine to leave a very long finish. Usually
        the strongest ale offered by a brewery, and in recent years many commercial
        examples are now vintage-dated. Normally aged significantly prior to release.
        Often associated with the winter or holiday season.

    notes: A classic ESB strain from one of England's largest independent breweries.
        This yeast is best suited for English style ales including milds, bitters,
        porters, and English style stouts. This yeast will leave a beer very clear,
        and will leave some residual sweetness.

    notes: 'This is the yeast from one of the oldest stout producing breweries in
        the world. It produces a slight hint of diacetyl, balanced by a light fruitiness
        and slight dry crispness. Great for Irish ales, stouts, porters, browns, reds

    notes: Clean, highly flocculent, and highly attenuative yeast. This yeast is similar
        to WLP002 in flavor profile, but is 10% more attenuative. This eliminates
        the residual sweetness, and makes the yeast well suited for high gravity ales.
        It is also reaches terminal gravity quickly. 80% attenuation will be reached
        even with 10% ABV beers.

    notes: Our "Brewer Patriot" strain can be used to reproduce many of the American
        versions of classic beer styles. Similar neutral character of WLP001, but
        less attenuation, less accentuation of hop bitterness, slightly less flocculation,
        and a little tartness. Very clean and low esters. Great yeast for golden,
        blonde, honey, pales and German alt style ales.

    notes: Our most popular yeast strain is WLP001, California Ale Yeast. This blend
        celebrates the strengths of California- clean, neutral fermentation, versatile
        usage, and adds two other strains that belong to the same 'clean/neutral'
        flavor category. The additional strains create complexity to the finished
        beer. This blend tastes more lager like than WLP001. Hop flavors and bitterness
        are accentuated, but not to the extreme of California. Slight sulfur will
        be produced during fermentation.

        aroma may be perceived from the ale yeast contribution. Hop flavors and bitterness
        are slightly subdued. Slight sulfur will be produced during fermentation,
        from the lager yeast.

    name: Wyeast - Bohemian Lager
    notes: Carlsberg type yeast, most widely used lager strain in the world. Produces
        a distinct malty profile with some ester character and a crisp finish. Benefits
        from a diacetyl rest at 14 C for 24 hours after fermentation is complete.
        Also used for pseudo-ale production with fermentations at 24 C which eliminates
        sulfur production.

        pineapple like aroma. B. claussenii is closely related to B. anomalus.

    name: WLP675 - Malolactic Bacteria
    notes: Malolactic fermentation is the conversion of malic acid to lactic acid
        by bacteria from the lactic acid bacteria family.  Lactic acid is less acidic
        than malic acid, which in turn decreases acidity and helps to soften and/or
        round out some of the flavors in wine.
